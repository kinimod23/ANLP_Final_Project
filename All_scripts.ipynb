    "We manually assigned scores to 100 headlines each from The Guardian and The Telegraph. The manual and the automatic scores are compared in two manners: 1. The polarity itself is compared, it is determined whether it lays in a predefined tolerance range. 2. It is determined whether the scores have the same polarity i.e. being negative (<0), positive (>0) or neutral (=0). As the system did not perform very well - only half of the headlines had the same polarity and only very few matched within the tolerance range - only few topic words could be found in the headlines - topic words only appeared in half of the headlines at all - we did not apply sentiment analysis to further interpret the clustered topics and we also did not improve the system to an aspect-based level."
