      "is aimed at fundamentalist Eurosceptics who never wanted Britain to be part of\n",
      "the EU in the first place. Nor is there any point in focusing on racists and\n",
      "xenophobes. People who don't like foreigners or people with coloured skin are\n",

      "prospectus by the leave campaign; but they need a better one, which offers them\n",
      "hope, support, material improvements in their lives, and confidence. Theresa May\n",
      "gets this, though she is doomed to promote Brexit and not to stop it. Those who\n",
      "want to stop Brexit need to learn this lesson: the aim of any campaign must be\n",
      "to persuade these voters that there is a better way of getting the things they\n",
      "want than leaving the EU. Don't berate, persuade. And get out of the bubble.\n",
      "\n",
      "The second key principle is to accept that this is a long game. Brexit won in\n",
      "June 2016. It won't be turned around quickly. Stopping Brexit is on the margins\n",
      "of political possibility right now. It could be that Brexit will be slowed by\n",
      "the supreme court's ruling, due in January. But that's just the start. Opponents\n",
      "of Brexit should settle in. Time is on their side.\n",
      "\n",
      "The negotiations with the EU will take a minimum of two years - longer if there\n",
      "is a transitional phase. The pressure to bring things to a head will be enormous\n",
      "and will grow, both in Britain and in the other 27 EU countries. British\n",
      "opponents of Brexit must be EU reformers too.\n",

      "Related:  Tony Blair: Brexit could be stopped if Britons change their minds\n",

      "The third point is to remember Cato. Chip away, every day. Every time something\n",
      "new and troubling happens, make it clear that things would be different if\n",
      "Brexit were stopped. This week's immigration figures showed a pre-referendum\n",
      "surge. Without Brexit this wouldn't have happened. Hate crimes have\n",
      "proliferated. Brexit shares the blame for that. When inflation rises and growth\n",
      "slows next year, make sure Brexit's role is spelled out. If ministers abandon\n",
      "the single market in favour of migration curbs, make Brexit's responsibility\n",
      "clear. Unless anti-Brexit campaigners have established in the public mind that\n",
      "there is a clear and viable no-Brexit alternative, they won't be in a position\n",
      "to make the most of their opportunities.\n",
      "\n",
      "The fourth point is the other side of the same coin. The leave campaign lied\n",
      "through its teeth about the benefits of Brexit. It said there would be ¬£350m\n",
      "extra every week for the NHS. Last week the chancellor said precisely nothing\n",
      "about any extra NHS spending in the next four years. And look what is actually\n",

      "It won't be easy to stop Brexit. But here are four ways to do it; Chip away, every day. This is a long game but, as harsh reality bites, time will be on the side of the remainers     Those of us with only a smattering of knowledge about the ancient world know one thing about Cato the Elder. During Rome's long wars against Hannibal, Cato ended every speech in the senate with the same words: \"Carthage must be destroyed.\"  \" Brexit must be stopped\" is unlikely to last as long as Cato's catchphrase has managed to. But it focuses the mind. Those who think Brexit must be stopped are not the majority. But they have a case and a cause, and they are right. So how might stoppage be achieved?  Probably not by a political movement headed by Tony Blair. The former prime minister is not heading back into frontline politics. But he is one of the biggest names to insist that Brexit is not yet irrevocable. He told the New Statesman last week that Brexit \" can be stopped if the British people decide that, having seen what it means, the pain-gain cost-benefit analysis doesn't stack up\". And on that he is absolutely right.  When inflation rises and growth slows next year, make sure Brexit's role is clearly spelled out  Blair carries so much baggage that it is inconceivable he either could or should play the leading role in any campaign. The Iraq war was wrong and it is no part of my argument that the past can be brushed aside. But Blair has serious things to say about Brexit that serious people ought to listen to. It's time his critics were big enough to give him a break. The 439-70 House of Commons vote this week against the SNP's effort to sanction Blair for the events of 2003 may suggest there is some space for the former Labour leader to at least be heard. But don't hold your breath.  If Brexit is to be stopped it will require time, a change of public mood, and an alliance. The SNP, Greens, Liberal Democrats, significant parts of the Labour party and a minority of Tories would all have roles to play. People from outside politics are crucial too. This week's joint press conference by Nick Clegg, Chuka Umunna and Anna Soubry was a start. But as Clegg says, to turn the referendum around needs the people's consent, not a procedural trick. This will only happen if the public mood changes. Anti-Brexit campaigners should try to change it, and here's how.  The first point is to be clear who they need to be talking to, rather than squabbling about which of them is entitled to do the talking. The name of this game is changing minds. So there is absolutely no point crafting a campaign that is aimed at fundamentalist Eurosceptics who never wanted Britain to be part of the EU in the first place. Nor is there any point in focusing on racists and xenophobes. People who don't like foreigners or people with coloured skin are not going to change their minds.  But that leaves a lot of people who voted for Brexit, in hundreds of thousands of cases, on the basis of their own experience. They were sold a false prospectus by the leave campaign; but they need a better one, which offers them hope, support, material improvements in their lives, and confidence. Theresa May gets this, though she is doomed to promote Brexit and not to stop it. Those who want to stop Brexit need to learn this lesson: the aim of any campaign must be to persuade these voters that there is a better way of getting the things they want than leaving the EU. Don't berate, persuade. And get out of the bubble.  The second key principle is to accept that this is a long game. Brexit won in June 2016. It won't be turned around quickly. Stopping Brexit is on the margins of political possibility right now. It could be that Brexit will be slowed by the supreme court's ruling, due in January. But that's just the start. Opponents of Brexit should settle in. Time is on their side.  The negotiations with the EU will take a minimum of two years - longer if there is a transitional phase. The pressure to bring things to a head will be enormous and will grow, both in Britain and in the other 27 EU countries. British opponents of Brexit must be EU reformers too.  Related:  Tony Blair: Brexit could be stopped if Britons change their minds  The third point is to remember Cato. Chip away, every day. Every time something new and troubling happens, make it clear that things would be different if Brexit were stopped. This week's immigration figures showed a pre-referendum surge. Without Brexit this wouldn't have happened. Hate crimes have proliferated. Brexit shares the blame for that. When inflation rises and growth slows next year, make sure Brexit's role is spelled out. If ministers abandon the single market in favour of migration curbs, make Brexit's responsibility clear. Unless anti-Brexit campaigners have established in the public mind that there is a clear and viable no-Brexit alternative, they won't be in a position to make the most of their opportunities.  The fourth point is the other side of the same coin. The leave campaign lied through its teeth about the benefits of Brexit. It said there would be ¬£350m extra every week for the NHS. Last week the chancellor said precisely nothing about any extra NHS spending in the next four years. And look what is actually happening to the NHS. The leave campaign landed the May government with a huge promise that it cannot deliver. The opposition parties need to link the two at every opportunity.  Stopping Brexit will not be easy. Recovering from a big defeat is hard. The campaign is more likely to fail than to succeed. The Brexiteers will fight very dirty. But the prize is immense - and Hannibal was defeated in a day.\n",
      "Brexit weekly briefing: May unclarifies strategy as EU converges; PM hints at leaving single market, then insists hard Brexit is not inevitable, amid turbulence of Sir Ivan Rogers' resignation     Welcome to the Guardian's weekly Brexit briefing, a summary of developments as Britain edges towards the EU exit. If you'd like to receive it as a weekly email, please sign up here (and check your spam folder if you don't see it in your inbox).  Producing the Guardian's independent, in-depth journalism takes a lot of time and money. But we do it because we believe our perspective matters - and it might well be your perspective, too. If you value our Brexit coverage, become a Guardian Supporter and help make our future more secure. Thank you.  The big picture  Maybe we should all start taking this \"full Brexit\" - or, as my colleague Dan Roberts called it - \"train crash Brexit\" idea seriously.  Or, of course, maybe not.  Theresa May gave what many said was her clearest hint yet that Britain will leave the single market when it exits the EU, telling Sophy Ridge on Sky News that immigration control (incompatible with single market membership) would be her top priority and that she was not interested in keeping \"bits of membership of the EU\".  The prime minister said she wanted \"UK companies to be able to trade in and within the EU and European companies to operate and trade in the UK\", but stressed that Brexit was about \"getting the right relationship\" with the EU from outside the bloc:  Often people talk as if somehow we are leaving the EU but we still want to kind of keep bits of membership of the EU. We are leaving. We are coming out. We will... have control of our borders, control of our laws.  A report from the thinktank Civitas gave the \"full Brexit\" idea legs, saying that while without a trade deal UK firms might face ¬£5bn on their exports, Britain could levy ¬£13bn on EU imports - leaving ¬£8.8bn for an industrial policy including research credits and cash for disadvantaged regions.  But May being May, no sooner had everyone responded to what they thought she'd said - including sterling, which dipped to its lowest level since October - than she denied it, insisting on Monday it was wrong to predict a \"hard Brexit\" :  I'm tempted to say the people who are getting it wrong are those who print things saying I'm talking about a hard Brexit, that a hard Brexit is inevitable... I don't accept the terms hard or soft Brexit.  All this followed an already turbulent week in which Britain's highly regarded (in the EU and the Foreign Office, at any rate) man in Brussels, Sir Ivan Rogers, resigned, accusing the government of \"muddled thinking\" and \"ill-founded arguments\".  Rogers, who reportedly criticised May to her predecessor, David Cameron, before resigning and warned of the danger of a \"disorderly Brexit\" (in which the UK walks away from the EU without any kind of deal), was promptly replaced by another career diplomat, Sir Tim Barrow.  The view from Europe  At the start of the year in which Britain will, if all goes according to May's plan, trigger article 50 and begin the process of leaving the EU, Joseph Muscat, prime minister of Malta - which holds the EU's rotating presidency - said the bloc had never been more unified than in its policy towards Brexit.  I spoke and visited basically all other 26 member states and there's a... convergence on the attitude towards Brexit. I have never seen such a convergence within the European family.  The European commission paid tribute to Rogers, saying it regretted \"the loss of a very professional, very knowledgeable, while not always easy interlocutor and diplomat\" as EU observers predicted his departure would be a major loss for the UK.  Marine Le Pen, the anti-EU Front National leader who is widely expected to make it to the second round of France's presidential elections this year, said that if she won she would demand control of France's borders, laws and economic and monetary policy from Brussels, and then call an in/out referendum.  In news that will have little impact on the UK's exit talks unless he actually wins (in which case he will resign as the European parliament's chief Brexit negotiator), the veteran federalist and former Belgian prime minister Guy Verhofstadt said he would run for the presidency of the 751-seat assembly. He is though unlikely to get very far.  Meanwhile, back in Westminster  With May's government visibly struggling over its approach to Brexit, surely this would be the time for the main opposition party to take full advantage? Not when that party is Labour, seemingly.  Interviewed on Sky News on Sunday immediately before May, Labour's deputy leader, Tom Watson made the slightly eye-opening claim that it was unfair to be asked what his party's position was on immigration after leaving the EU.  Watson did argue this was mainly because Labour - along with the rest of the country - still has no idea what sort of post-Brexit future May is seeking to chart. But his comments underline the fact that Labour is divided on what it is seeking from the Brexit process, especially over the free movement of EU nationals.  While Watson indicated he would support some new if undefined controls over immigration - a stance also espoused by Labour's shadow Brexit secretary, Keir Starmer - that position is by no means unanimous, with the party leader, Jeremy Corbyn, still refusing to endorse any limitations on free movement.  At least the Liberal Democrats have a united front on this, though. Well, not quite any more. Party grandee Vince Cable has said he now believes a \"more rational\" post-Brexit immigration policy will involve controls on movements from the EU.  \"There is no great argument of liberal principle for free EU movement; the economics is debatable and the politics is conclusively hostile,\" Cable wrote in the New Statesman. (A Lib Dem spokesman was brutal: \"Vince's views are his own; he is not a member of parliament and does not speak for the party.\")  You should also know:       ¬∑    Scotland's PM, Nicola Sturgeon, reiterated that she would hold a           second referendum on Scottish independence in the event of a hard           Brexit.      ¬∑    Norway's PM predicted a \"a very hard Brexit\" because the UK's 40-year           membership of the EU has left it lacking negotiating experience.      ¬∑    Senior civil servants disillusioned over Brexit preparations are           considering stepping down amid growing tensions with Downing Street.      ¬∑    A top Canadian trade negotiater said the UK risks a \"catastrophic\"           Brexit because the government is so dismissive of trade experts.      ¬∑    The UK services sector grew at its fastest pace in more than 18 months           in December as the economy continued to shrug off Brexit worries.      ¬∑    The Bank of England's chief economist said his profession is in crisis           after failing to foresee the 2008 crash and misjudging the impact of           the Brexit vote.      ¬∑    The environment secretary, Andrea Leadsom, promised a bonfire of           regulations for farmers after Brexit.      ¬∑    Lord Wolfson, pro-leave chief executive of clothes retailer Next,           urged the government to lay out some of the core principles of its           Brexit strategy.      ¬∑    Britain risks losing (EURO)40bn of direct EU funding once it leaves           the bloc, according to UK parliament figures.      ¬∑    Some 42% more people applied for Irish passports in 2016 than in the           year before the Brexit vote, Irish government figures showed.      ¬∑    A 32-year-old man born to German parents in Britain who has lived here           all his was told to take a citizenship test.
