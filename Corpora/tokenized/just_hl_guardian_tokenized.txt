Tony Blair confirmed last month that he is trying to stop Brexit and he is intervening again today . He is giving an interview to the Today programme and he has published a long article on the subject , summarised here by my colleague Peter Walker . Here is the start of Peter 's story . Labour will become `` the handmaiden of Brexit '' if it continues to prevaricate and be timid over the issue , Tony Blair has warned in a passionate call for the party he formerly led to oppose the government on leaving the EU . In a lengthy article published on his own website , coinciding with the release of a report from his political institute detailing the current state of play over Brexit , Blair reiterates his call for the British people to have the final decision on whether the withdrawal from the EU goes ahead or not . Describing 2018 as `` the year when the fate of Brexit and thus of Britain will be decided '' , Blair is open about his opposition to leaving the EU and argues that the 2016 referendum can not be seen as binding as it contained no detail on what a post-Brexit future would involve . And here is Peter 's story in full .

Two days after the DUP scuppered the UK-EU Brexit deal at the last moment , it is now clear , as our over overnight splash reports , that a cabinet revolt is stirring . The pro-Brexit papers have all got versions of the same story . This is from today 's Sun . The Sun has learned that Boris [ Johnson ] spoke out over his fears about it at the weekly meeting of the PM 's top table of ministers this morning . Mr Johnson told Mrs May that he `` would worry if regulatory alignment bound us into the EU '' . A senior Whitehall source added : `` Cabinet is in the dark about what the PM is doing now , which is a very strange state of affairs to be in '' . This is from the Daily Telegraph ( paywall ) . David Davis , the brexit secretary , said that any alignment between the north and south in Ireland would apply to the whole of the UK , which Leave supporters interpreted as Britain remaining yoked to the EU . One cabinet source said : `` It seems that either Northern Ireland is splitting from the rest of the UK or we are headed for high alignment with the EU , which certainly has n't been agreed by cabinet . The prime minister is playing a risky game . '' And this is from the Daily Mail . Boris Johnson and Michael Gove are said to be leading a revolt of Brexiteers who have a 'genuine fear ' that Mrs May is going to push through a soft option . The foreign secretary reportedly confronted the prime minister in a dramatic clash during cabinet yesterday over her negotiating strategy . We will be hearing from David Davis , the Brexit secretary , Theresa May and Philip Hammond , the chancellor , on this subject today , with Davis up shortly . Here is the agenda for the day . 9.15am : David Davis , the Brexit secretary , gives evidence to the Commons Brexit committee . 12pm : Theresa May faces Jeremy Corbyn at PMQs .

I think frankly last night was avoidable and it 's regrettable it went the way it did . '' Asked if he would vote against the Brexit date amendment , Hammond said : `` I did n't say that . I said I hope I do n't have to rebel again . I think a lot of people will view that proposition as unnecessary , probably not a good way to negotiate . Answering questions in the Commons on Thursday , the Brexit secretary , David Davis , gave no comment when asked by his Labour shadow , Keir Starmer , whether he would drop the `` ill-conceived gimmick '' of the Brexit date amendment or face another defeat . Davis said only that he would respect any vote by MPs . However , asked by Starmer if the government would seek to `` undermine or overturn '' Wednesday night 's defeat , he said no decisions had been made . The impact of Grieve 's amendment would be to bring a `` very compressed timetable '' to the Brexit legislative process . `` Those who want to see a smooth and orderly exit from the European Union will hopefully want to see a working statute book , '' he said . `` And so we will have to think about how we respond to it . But as always , we take the House of Commons ' view seriously , and will continue to do so . '' Hammond and Grieve were criticised by colleagues and pro-Brexit media on Wednesday night , with the Tory MP Nadine Dorries and former ConservativeHome editor Tim Montgomerie going as far as suggesting they should be deselected . Other backers of amendment 7 were also criticised , including the former education secretary Nicky Morgan , former business minister Anna Soubry , and Cambridge MP Heidi Allen . Speaking in the Commons during Brexit questions , Soubry had a testy exchange with opponents on her own benches . When Soubry began by saying none of the rebels `` took any pleasure '' in what they did , one Tory MP shouted that the rebels drank champagne to celebrate . Soubry stopped her question to say : `` Nobody drank champagne , not on these benches . Let 's just nail that one . These are serious matters . '' Grieve also said rebels would not be deterred . `` I 'm not very concerned about knives being out for me , '' he said . `` I 'm in parliament to do my duty by my constituents and by my country . I 'm sorry to hear if colleagues think so ill of me but it 's not going to affect what I do one jot . '' Hammond declined to comment on calls for deselections . `` I make a cardinal rule not to be rude about my colleagues in public and I am not going to start now , '' he said . The MP said some degree of flexibility around the article 50 deadline , two years from the date May triggered the official notification that the UK is leaving the EU , was crucial . However , he said that would be a matter of weeks because of the need to conclude beforeJune 's EU parliament elections . `` Nothing that happened yesterday stops Brexit ; nothing that happened yesterday actually undermines the prime minister in any way , '' he said . `` If [ the Brexit deal ] is concluded by October next year , that gives six months if things go wrong . What we want to see is a deal negotiated in good time , so it can be scrutinised and passed by the House of Commons . '' May will travel to a crucial EU summit on Thursday under the cloud of her Commons defeat , somewhat marring last week 's fillip provided by the European commission , which said that negotiations had made `` sufficient progress '' on EU citizens ' rights , the financial settlement and the Irish border to move negotiations to the second phase - the future relationship . Downing Street said it would `` respect the will of MPs '' but may seek to amend the bill again during later stages of its passage through parliament .

The Sun likes stirring things up , and it has certainly managed to do that this morning . Here 's its splash . enltrSUN EXCLUSIVE : Queen backs Brexit # tomorrowspaperstoday # bbcpaperspic.twitter.com/dAmjFMOl1c - Neil Henderson ( @ hendopolis ) March 8 , 2016 And here 's the story . Astute readers will note that the story does not actually justify the headline , although , to be fair , Tom Newton Dunn , the journalist who wrote this story , can spot this too . His intro does not say that the Queen is backing Brexit , just that she has been `` hailed as a backer of Brexit '' by Tory MPs told about the two anecdotes at the heart of the story . The first is about what the Queen reportedly told Nick Clegg at a lunch in 2011 . Her Majesty let rip at the then Deputy PM during a lunch at Windsor Castle , The Sun has been told . The 89-year-old monarch firmly told passionate pro-European Mr Clegg that she believed the EU was heading in the wrong direction . Her stinging reprimand went on for `` quite a while '' , leaving other guests around the table stunned . The Sun also backs this up with a second anecdote about what the Queen said at a reception `` a few years ago '' . One of a group of Parliamentarians in a circle with her at the time asked Her Majesty for her thoughts on Brussels . The Queen is said to have snapped back angrily : `` I do n't understand Europe '' . A parliamentary source , who relayed the remark to The Sun , said : `` It was said with quite some venom and emotion . I shall never forget it '' . As the Guardian reports in our version , Clegg has denied the story . Related : Queen 's Brexit rant never happened , says Nick Clegg And this morning Sir Ed Davey , the former Lib Dem energy secretary , has claimed that the Queen probably wants Britain to stay in the EU - so that Scotland does not vote for independence . He told the Today programme . The Queen knows that if we vote to pull out of the EU , it 's the surest way to destroy the United Kingdom , because Scotland will then vote to go independent , as we all know . So I very much doubt she holds the views that are given her in the Sun . I know Her Majesty believes in the United Kingdom , believes in Great Britain . And if we pull out of the EU , we will destroy our country because Scotland will go independent , the peace process in Northern Ireland will be under real pressure and we wo n't have something called the United Kingdom or Great Britain any more . I doubt the Queen wants that . I 'll cover a bit more of this nonsense as the morning goes on . As for the rest of the day , here is the agenda . 9am : A conference opens on social mobility in schools , with speeches from Nick Gibb , the schools minister , and Sir Michael Wilshaw , the Ofsted chief inspector . 9.30am : The Office for National Statistics publishes figures on zero-hours contracts . 10.30am : The child abuse inquiry holds a preliminary hearing into allegations involving the late Lord Janner . 12pm : David Cameron faces Jeremy Corbyn at PMQs . Around 12.40pm : MPs begin debating the enterprise bill . The vote on Sunday trading is expected at around 3.45pm . 2.30pm : Lord Kerslake , the former head of the civil sevice , gives evidence to the public accounts committee about extending right to buy to housing association tenants . 3.15pm : David Anderson , the independent reviewer of terrorist legislation , gives evidence to the human rights committee . Later I will be focusing on PMQs and the Sunday trading revolt . But I will also be covering the breaking political news as it happens , as well as bringing you the best reaction , comment and analysis from the web . I will post a summary at lunchtime and another in the afternoon . If you want to follow me or contact me on Twitter , I 'm on @ AndrewSparrow . I try to monitor the comments BTL but normally I find it impossible to read them all . If you have a direct question , do include `` Andrew '' in it somewhere and I 'm more likely to find it . I do try to answer direct questions , although sometimes I miss them or do n't have time . Alternatively you could post a question to me on Twitter . If you think there are any voices that I 'm leaving out , particularly political figures or organisations giving alternative views of the stories I 'm covering , do please flag them up below the line ( include `` Andrew '' in the post ) . I ca n't promise to include everything , but I do try to be open to as wide a range of perspectives as possible .
