Davis say only that he would respect any vote by MP . however , ask by Starmer if the government would seek to ` ` undermine or overturn ' ' Wednesday night ' S defeat , he say no decision have be make . the impact of Grieve ' S amendment would be to bring a ` ` very compress timetable ' ' to the Brexit legislative process . ` ` Those who want to see a smooth and orderly exit from the European Union will hopefully want to see a work statute book , ' ' he say . ` ` and so we will have to think about how we respond to it . but as always , we take the House of Commons ' view seriously , and will continue to do so .

Soubry stop her question to say : ` ` nobody drink champagne , not on these bench . Let ' s just nail that one . these be serious matter . ' ' Grieve also say rebel would not be deter . ` ` I ' m not very concern about knife be out for me , ' ' he say . ` ` I ' m in parliament to do my duty by my constituent and by my country . I ' m sorry to hear if colleague think so ill of me but it ' S not go to affect what I do one jot . ' ' Hammond decline to comment on call for deselections . ` ` I make a cardinal rule not to be rude about my colleague in public and I be not go to start now , ' ' he say . the MP say some degree of flexibility around the article @card@ deadline , two year from the date May trigger the official notification that the UK be leave the EU , be crucial . however , he say that would be a matter of week because of the need to conclude beforeJune ' s EU parliament election . ` ` nothing that happen yesterday stop Brexit ; nothing that happen yesterday actually undermine the prime minister in any way , ' ' he say . ` ` if [ the Brexit deal ] be conclude by October next year , that give six month if thing go wrong . what we want to see be a deal negotiate in good time , so it can be scrutinise and pass by the House of Commons .
