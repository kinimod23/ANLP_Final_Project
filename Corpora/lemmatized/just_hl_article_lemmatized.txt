sack Tory @card@ TURN up Heat ON BREXIT ; THERE ' S No GOVE-ING Back MP to keep watch Three Tories who lose their job in the Cabinet reshuffle aim to take over powerful committee scrutinise Brexit . former Justice Secretary Michael Gove , ex-Culture Secretary John Whittingdale and former justice minister Dominic Raab plan to ensure Britain ' s EU pullout go ahead . all three campaign to leave and be either sack by PM Theresa May or walk out after be pass over for promotion . now two Commons select committee be be set up to scrutinise the Brexit Ministry and the newly-create Department for International Trade . last night a source close to the trio say : ` ` it would be the perfect way to hold the government ' S foot to the fire and ensure Brexit really mean Brexit ' ' . it come amid Eurosceptics ' grow fear that Ministers could water down demand to Brussels - and even give in to call for a second referendum . by standing for election to the committee , the trio would still be involve in Brexit . and it follow fear that Brexit Secretary David Davis , Trade boss Liam Fox and Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson could fall out . one Eurosceptic Tory MP say : ` ` do not underestimate the likelihood that they screw this up . ` ` Winning the referendum be not the end of it - the really hard stuff come now , and there can be no rowing back . ' ' meanwhile , businessman Richard Tice have set up lead leave , which plan to hold Mrs May to account on her pledge to leave the EU . he say : ` ` when it come to negotiate Brexit , no deal be good than a bad deal . ' '
over To EU ; UK Must ' LISTEN ' To RULINGS Euro judge to sit on Brexit panel PM deny big court compromise Euro judge would sit on Brexit panel to settle dispute between Britain and the EU in a compromise plan suggest by minister . the UK would also have to listen to the European Court of Justice ' S decision and may have to consult with it after leave . the scenario emerge in the Brexit ministry ' s new position paper aim at solve a negotiation stand-off . London and Brussels be at loggerhead over EU insistence the Luxembourg court must oversee part of the Brexit deal . PM Theresa May be force to deny any of the proposal mean she have weaken her stance on stop Euro judge make British law after Brexit . there be also anger among some Tory that EU judge could still overrule UK court for year after Britain leave in March @card@ . Whitehall official contradict Mrs May ' s declaration that the ECJ ' s ` ` direct jurisdiction ' ' would end on that date by say it could still be in force during a transition period of up to three year until @card@ . the PM insist Brexit would still mean the UK would ` ` take back control of our law ' ' . most senior Brexiteers back the compromise plan , with Tory Eurosceptic Bernard Jenkin describe them as ` ` normal nation-to-nation dispute resolution mechanism ' ' . but Brexit-backing legal expert Martin Howe QC say : ` ` we must not have the ECJ via the back door . ' ' meanwhile , minister publish a fresh position paper , the fifth this week , on protect Britain ' S Â£118billion digital economy after Brexit . disrupt cross-border datum would be hugely costly for the UK and the EU , Minister for Digital Matt Hancock say . incoming President of the Supreme Court Baroness Hale of Richmond say politician - one from the government and one opposition member - should help select Britain ' s most senior judge .
BREXIT Clarity BOOST for Tories THE Cabinet ' s Brexit compromise be begin to come into focus . the Chancellor , Philip Hammond , below , get a three-year transition in which not much change to try to smooth out the process of leave , while the Brexiteers will eventually get their version of Brexit - Britain out of the single market and the custom union . if the EU play ball , then this be a fairly sensible solution . there be nothing wrong with a transition as long as it be timelimited . Britain must not end up be stick half in , half out for ever . crucially , Hammond accept that this transition need to end before the next election , mean the opposition can not try to turn that vote into a referendum on Brexit . when Theresa May give her Brexit speech in September we will get confirmation of what transitional deal this country be seek . but there be a political , as well as a governing , imperative for clarity from the government . for it be only when the Cabinet be agree on a policy that the Tories can begin to take Labour to task for their contradictory position on Brexit . since the election , the Shadow Cabinet have have more stance on Brexit than Coleen Rooney have have holiday . but the Tories have n't be able to exploit this confusion as they can not contrast this with their own clear position . Labour ' s inability to say whether they want to be in or out of the single market or the custom union be absurd . these be two of the big question face the country , and a party that think it will be in power sooner rather than later should have answer to them .
Sturgeon ' s surge to free the Scots Nicola Sturgeon ' s bold intention to hold a second Scottish independence referendum within two year have certainly put the cat among the pigeon . as Theresa May ' S government railroad its Brexit Bill through the British house of Parliament , the intervention of the Scottish First Minister be a welcome reminder that the Tory Brexit show be not the only one in town . as always , Sturgeon ' S timing be impeccable . she choose to make her big announcement on the day of the Brexit vote in the House of Commons . it also happen to be the week Theresa May intend to formally trigger the Article @card@ process to leave the EU . in one fall swoop , Sturgeon manage to take all the sheen off the government ' s ' victory ' in parliament . she also , incredibly , force the government into an embarrassing delay to the formal start of the Brexit process . not a bad day ' s work for the Scottish leader . some on the pro-Brexit side see this as a cynical last-ditch move by Sturgeon and the Scottish Nationalist party to save her political career and thwart the ' will ' of the British people . this be an inaccurate portrayal of the fact . since the Scottish referendum in @card@ , circumstance have change dramatically . the decision by the UK last year to leave the EU be one against which the majority of the people of Scotland ( @card@ per cent ) vote . that dissent , along with Northern Ireland ' S , be acknowledge by Prime Minister May and promise be make to involve the Scot in plan the Brexit process . as the tide within the government race toward a hard and destructive exit from the EU , so too harden the position of May and her government towards sottish involvement . lead voice in Scotland look for a settlement which would see them stay in the Single Market and the Customs Union . as Sturgeon and other advocate for a soft and economically less damaging Brexit , the PM turn on them for dare to have a different view on the way forward . this disregard for Scottish concern , and the disrespect show toward the elect government in Edinburgh , have directly lead to the announcement of this referendum . Theresa May and her cavalier colleague in Whitehall have only themselves to blame . allegation that Sturgeon be play a ` ` political game ' ' with this propose referendum ring hollow come from a PM who herself engage in the most high-risk political game in British history . the depth of feeling in Scotland about the Brexit decision can not be underestimate . SNP deputy leader Angus Robertson say on Monday night he do not want to ` ` sit in the back of the Tory Brexit bus and see the prime minister drive us off a Brexit cliff ' ' . many Labour and Tory MP in Westminster have express similar sentiment , but they have fail to step up and be count . at least the Scottish nationalist be put their money where their mouth be . a referendum be high-risk , but arguably so be stay mute on as destructive a course as Brexit be shape up to be . there be plenty of scoff from pro- Brexit wag about the fate of the Scottish independence referendum . they say it can not pass , because so many issue which be raise in the previous referendum have yet to be answer . this be ironic thinking , give that these same people campaign for the UK ' s exit from the EU without be able to answer any of the fundamental question in a meaningful way . the Brexiteers win because they appeal to heart and mind , rather than to rationality or reason . they would be foolish to assume the SNP and all those campaigning for Scottish independence can not do the same . the emotive argument be far more highly charge now than they be for the last independence campaign . Scot be a proud people , who see their global future as a partner in the EU and on the world stage . the prospect of retreat into ' Little Britain ' horrify them . yes , Scottish economic fortune have take a hit with the collapse of oil price , and yes , the path to independence would be one of economic uncertainty . but unlike the last campaign , the unionist can not promise any great economic security within the UK . they ' ve sacrifice certainty , and quite probably economic success , for some nebulous concept of ' sovereignty ' . so why do they assume the Scot wo n't do the same ? circumstance have change since the last Scottish referendum . remain in the UK be no long the safe harbour which it arguably be in @card@ . suddenly , assert its own independent path within the EU look like a rather appealing and secure option . my money be on Scotland secede from the Union . what a legacy that will be for Mrs May . and what incendiary issue will it raise in Northern Ireland ? the break-up of the UK be firmly on the card .
Brexit look as if it ' s a balls-up ; Scottish Sun the page where you tell Scotland what you think letter what kind of state be Britain go to be in after Brexit ? your columist Andrew Nicoll be spot on when he say the SNP will be quite happy to see it fail . and they wo n't be the only one - the majority of Scot vote to stay in the EU , but they be not listen too . Scotland should be ready to ditch England if it want to continue on this devastating course of action . Brian MCGINLAY Rutherglen , Lanarkshire HOW can we have any confidence in this government when we be tell free movement be to end in @card@ and then we be tell that a transition period will take until @card@ , just in time for the next General Election . be this to allow this government when they fail again to say it be not their fault that Brexit fail ? we deserve a government that can do the job not this useless Tory party . Hugh Campbell Coatbridge WE seem to be lead by incompetent who just do n't know what they be do . the fact that Brexit negotiation be go at a snail ' S pace make me think the whole thing will collapse , leave us in possible poverty and political limbo . Helen Muir Dundee Chancellor Philip Hammond , picture , should resign after his comment about people be happy to let mass immigration continue for year after Brexit . this be not what the British public vote for and if this spineless government ca n't deliver Brexit bring someone in that can . Gary Britain by email the EU Brexit negotiator be laugh up their sleeve . they only have to sit back and watch the remain saboteur from the United Kingdom do the job for them , and it appear that Chancellor Philip Hammond be their ace card . Theresa May should reshuffle her negotiation team to MP who vote to leave . transitional period will only give them more time to cripple Brexit altogether . john TALLAN Hamilton I WAS astound to learn that Durham police be no longer intend to prosecute non-commercial grower of cannabis plant . what they do n't seem to realise be that these addictive weed grow like courgette and we all know just how much trouble courgette grower have give away their massive crop . such policy can only lead to the privatisation of the police force in order to uphold standard and save our youth from the ravage of these evil plant . john Eoin Douglas Edinburgh in life you often only get a small window of opportunity to deal with thing . regard North Korea , the Americans have wait too long already . some people only understand and respect force . I hope Kim Jong-un do not have as much as a bad hair day - who know where it could lead ? William Strang Falkirk
what BREXIT Means To EU ; Irish Eye up Vital UK Poll This referendum be a no-brainer . economist rarely concur with each other but on Brexit , the OECD , IMF , IBEC and the ESRI all agree that Brexit represent a serious threat to the economy of the UK , Ireland and Northern Ireland . e The UK be our large trading partner with ( Euro ) 1.2billion trade over the Irish sea weekly . IBEC estimate this could be hit by as much as @card@ per cent in the event of Brexit . that ' s the type of economic earthquake we could do without . the UK trade more with us than it do with China , India and Brazil combine . s Ireland and the UK must be the two most integrated nation in the world . there ca n't be an Irish family without friend and love one in the UK . Brexit create so much uncertainty for those living across the two nation . it be no coincidence there have be a big rise in passport application . leave do n't have many answer when it come to crucial issue such as continuance and transfer of pension right . there be also the serious consideration as to how Brexit will impact relation between Ireland and Northern Ireland . if leave win we ' ll see a hardening of the northern Irish border with increase custom and migration check . Ba Stay S h this have be confirm as inevitable by both the UK and Irish government . we view this as a massively retrograde step in the harmony of our island . during our campaign , Irish4Europe have be reach out to the Irish who can vote . we ' re ask Irish people with a vote to consider the terrible impact a Brexit would have on us and our close friend and neighbour . the last thing we need be a Brexit . Let ' s build bridge not border . anything Ireland get from a Brexit will simply be peripheral but one of the main thing it would raise be the issue of our membership of the eurozone . the euro have be an absolute disaster . we join the euro and effectively say we ' d go for lunch . it begin the process which leave to us with ( Euro ) 64billion of bank debt . a Brexit would force our pro-EU political elite to have a rethink . it ' d also have a massive impact across Europe . go -It would get people think about take power back from the EU to member state and halt the integration process . nation would then get the chance to take back some of the authority we ' ve cede unquestioningly to Brussels . for the past @card@ year our political elite have be totally submissive to the EU . this one-way process have hugely contribute to the rise of populism across Europe , the racism and xenophobia . fishing right be one area where there need to be a drastic rethink . that have be disastrous for Donegal , Wexford and the North . this also apply to law . around two-third originate in Brussels and be nod through here . but Denmark get prior warning of EU law come and can give input . we should push for this , rather than be at the end of the process . free trade will continue between Ireland and the UK under all realistic leave scenario , so there will be no custom post on the border . such claim be simply scaremongering . Post-Brexit would see a huge and necessary debate . we need to ask question rather than the groupthink happen at the moment . time to go . . Farage be key leave back

' ' Furious Tory backbencher say it be a blatant bid to delay Brexit . Mr Davis say Theresa May have lay bare the government ' S position last week in a speech where she reveal Britain would seek to leave the single market . and he add that go public with the entire strategy would ` ` undermine ' ' talk with the EU . last night No10 refuse to rule out a White Paper . but the PM ' s official spokesman say : ` ` we will do nothing to undermine our negotiate position .

Mrs May have pledge Â£18billion but last night it be claim that could increase to break the deadlock before next month ' s EU summit .
EU TURN..BREXIT Will NOT Cost BRITS Â£2.2K the head of a group that warn Brexit would cost every British household Â£2,200 have backtrack on the threat . Angel Gurria , OECD secretary-general , say the quality of life in Brexit Britain will ` ` probably remain as it be today ' ' . his comment come a year after the economic organisation enrage Brexit backer with a ' Project Fear ' warning to voter . the group warn leaving would impose a ` ` persistent and rise cost on the economy ' ' amount to the equivalent of Â£2,200 per household by @card@ . speak yesterday , Mr Gurria say the OECD have try to persuade voter of the danger of a ` ` Brexit tax ' ' on live standard . but he say : ` ` the quality of life will probably remain as it be today , because the value will remain the same . ' ' Last September , the OECD warn Brexit would hit the UK economy later but harder than think . but in March it improve its @card@ forecast , say the impact have be less severe . yesterday ' s OECD report also reveal the number of foreign resident hit @card@ million between @card@ and @card@ - mean that @card@ per cent of the population be overseas national . the number of people give settlement right and number of asylum application both fall .
Eur mess it all up , Theresa all up , Theresa Theresa May yesterday move from make it up as she go along on Brexit to reach staggering new depth of incompetence . all day it appear she be negotiate a separate deal for Northern Ireland - infuriate government in Scotland , Wales and Gibraltar and add fuel to the fire of IndyRef2 . instead , it seem , she plan an offer which would see the whole of the UK stick to share rule with Europe over key area like agriculture and energy . and , somehow , she aim to pretend that be still Brexit . Mrs May have persistently parrot the catchphrase ` ` Brexit mean Brexit . ' ' well , whatever it mean , it do not mean stick to the same rule and regulation as before it ' S just possible she could have sell that nonsense to her own Cabinet , but not to the voter . all this have prove be that , in a surprise to nobody but Michael Gove and Boris Johnson , Brexit be an impossibly difficult and tangled process . impossible The EU have make it clear that , in any talk , it will side with its member state Ireland over the UK , which want to go . until yesterday the UK Government have refuse to engage with the concern of Dublin over the border , despite Euro estimate that Brexit could cut the Irish economy by @card@ per cent a year . instead it have insist all part of the UK must have the same Brexit www.deal.No shading , no difference . it ' s one out , all out - and that go for Ulster , Scotland , Wales and even Gibraltar . that have prove an impossible conundrum , apparently beyond the wit of anybody in government . when the Holyrood Government come forward with a plan to allow Scotland to stay inside the EU custom zone , Brexit Minister David Davis brand it unthinkable and fling it in the bin . instead Mrs May opt for a one-in , all-in approach , apply existing Euro rule to all part of the UK - whether they vote to get out or not . she face an impossible choice . by ditch a special deal on the Irish border , the PM will jeopardise the entire Brexit process . by force the whole country to stay in the EU while pretend we have leave , she will spark another political civil war .

Wise up , guy : Brexit be go to happen here be my New Year ' s resolution for all those eyebulging anti-Brexit bigot . Let ' s have a brand new start for Heseltine , Blair and Osborne , for Nick Clegg , Sir Keir Starmer and Sir Vince Cable and anyone else who think they have the right to veto democracy . in @card@ , resolve that you will finally accept the result of the EU referendum . in @card@ , you will understand that Brexit be really happen and nothing on earth can stop it now . in @card@ , you will admit to yourself that the large vote in the history of British democracy must be respect . and in @card@ , you will finally stop all your pathetic , mealy mouth whine about Brexit . because , quite frankly , the anti- Brexit bleat be become more than a little hysterical . Lord Heseltine , @card@ , right - one of those youthful anti-Brexit voter we have hear so much about - suggest that a Jeremy Corbyn government that would destroy our economy , take union law back to the seventy and insert a gang of craven IRA groupie in Downing Street , would be good for this country than leave the European Union . Nick Clegg , due to be knight for his service to lie to student and turf out of his Sheffield Hallam constituency by voter in the General Election , publish a book call how to stop Brexit , as if democracy can be cancel . and George Osborne tell colleague at the Evening Standard newspaper that he will not rest until ` ` Theresa May be chop up in bag in my freezer ' ' . can you imagine if Nigel Farage use that kind of violent language about a pro-Brussels woman like Anna Soubry or Nicky Morgan ? he would be drum out of public life forever . but the anti-Brexit bigot have be free to spew their rage . and in @card@ it have to end . because this country ' s departure from the EU be unstoppable now . and there be nothing that can conceivably happen - not Theresa May leave Downing Street , not Keir Starmer put on his angry face , not the endless sneering of the establishment - to stop it . we should be optimistic about our country ' S future . now get it sort the Remainers have continue to predict that the UK be doom outside of the EU . and it be clearly not true . economic expert predict that the British economy will overtake France ' S by @card@ . that ' S despite Brexit , as they say on the BBC . we want to be good neighbour . we want to continue to buy German car , Italian clothes and French wine . and despite the huff and puff of the bum of Brussel such as Barnier and Juncker , they want to keep sell us their good . why would n't they ? leave a crumble , federalist empire to take back control of your own destiny can never be a bad move . the people have speak . now get it sort . and make a New Year ' s resolution to finally stop all the anti-Brexit bellyache . even a perfectly rational decision such as the reintroduction of blue passport be treat as though we be bring back slavery . for decade , those of us who dream of the UK leave the European Union be deride as raving loony . but today it be the Project fear merchant who be foam at the mouth . so who be the nutjobs now ? thank you for read this column over the past year and I wish you and yours peace and happiness in @card@ . happy New year !

forget Brexit ' talk ' ... we ' ve pay bill , now let ' s check out of the EU hotel ; Britain Ca N'T Wait TIL @card@ To Go it be time to stop use the mislead term ` ` Brexit negotiation ' ' . Britain ' s exit from the European Union be not subject to negotiation . it have be determine by the British people - the sole legitimate authority on this issue . one negotiate to enter an institution , not to leave it . we be simply check out of the EU hotel . we pay our bill long ago and be free to leave . we be merely say a courteous farewell . the weasel term ` ` negotiation ' ' - too uncritically accept by Leavers - suggest we can only leave the EU by gracious permission of the Brussels apparatchik , that they will decide how many law , regulation and even payment into the EU budget will still be impose on Britain . unhappily , many British civil servant who will be involve in the ` ` negotiation ' ' share this absurd mindset . the mentality of these people , marinate in the habit of deference to the EU , be that Britain be an offender petition the parole board for early release . the government ' s pretence that Article @card@ can not be trigger until next year typify this delusion . why should hundred of British official toil unnecessarily to prepare for complex and protracted ` ` negotiation ' ' with an entity we be abandon to its increasingly ominous fate ? when EU apparatchik place voluminous document for ` ` negotiation ' ' on the table , they should simply be sweep on to the floor as irrelevant . since voting for Brexit , the United Kingdom be no longer subject to one sentence or comma of the monumental acquis communautaire , or accumulate body of EU law . Remainers ' delusion British ` ` negotiator ' ' be only create imaginary obstacle to our departure . trade agreement - the only area in which the term ` ` negotiation ' ' be relevant - can be conduct separately from the brief formality of departure and conclude after finalisation of Brexit . there be now two level of delusion among the survive Remainers . at the most extreme level be the cerebrally challenge view that Britain ' s exit from the EU can somehow be prevent . the headline report this hallucinatory mindset speak for themselves : ` ` we wo n't trigger Article @card@ until after @card@ - and that mean Brexit may never happen at all ' ' , ` ` Brexit ' could be delay until late @card@ ' with Whitehall department not yet ready to trigger Article @card@ ' ' , ` ` the UK Supreme Court have a clear legal path to block Article @card@ and stop Brexit ' ' . the arrogant implication behind these fantasy of the defeat Entitled Ones be that the will of 17.4million voter be illegitimate because they be ` ` stupid ' ' . if Brexit be delay as suggest in those headline the public backlash would be on a scale unseen in England since the 17th century . if activist judge be to block the clear will of the British electorate , at a time when confidence in both the judicial and political system have never be low , they would be court disaster . and if the Supreme Court uphold the Brexit vote , what would the malcontent do - appeal to the European court ? the majority have finally assert its right and will not be deny them . the second , marginally less insane , delusion be that the Brexit ` ` negotiation ' ' can somehow be protracted , complicated and fudge so that the EU can claw back control of Britain and impose almost as many law and regulation as under full membership . the EU anthem and flag would have to be sacrifice , but through some form of ` ` associate membership ' ' , ` ` Norway model ' ' or other device , Britain could end up remain in the Single Market , subject to EU law while exclude from any role in make them , still unable to control immigration - the key referendum issue - and contribute to the EU budget . in other word , in a bad situation than under full membership . Iain Duncan Smith , the prominent leave campaigner who be well aware of this conspiracy ( to give it its proper name ) , recently call on Theresa May to take measure to ensure Brexit be enact imminently , with Britain leave the Single Market . he say the Brexit decision must not deteriorate into a ` ` neverendum ' ' . he be right and it ' s high time leave supporter abandon timidity and spell out some home truth . the Remainers make much of predict chaos in the market , which do not materialise . but the market , which have now factor Brexit into their calculation , notoriously loathe uncertainty . yet the Remain bunker , formerly so concern about the market , be engineer prolonged uncertainty , to the detriment of investment . the most urgent issue for the leave camp now be the psychology of Britain ' s approach to the EU . our so-called ` ` negotiator ' ' need to present themselves in Brussels as soon as possible and say : ` ` you can put away all those mountain of bumf , we ' re only here to say goodbye nicely . we do n't want any form of associate membership , thank you very much . trench warfare ` ` what part of ' we ' re outta here ' do n't you understand ? now , bring us the visitor ' book and we ' ll sign out . ' ' that be what a majority of Briton want . not only the 17.4million voter who support Brexit , but a grow number of former Remainers . in the immediate aftermath of the referendum , distraught Remainers , notably the BBC , construct an anecdotal narrative of ` ` Leaver remorse ' ' that claim many leave voter regret their action . few such people concretely materialise . this myth be base on the genuine shock of voter , long accustom to impotence under consensus politics , startle to find they have successfully impose their will on the political class . surprise be misrepresent as regret . now that the postreferendum excitement have die down , a genuine phenomenon have emerge of many Remain voter , in the democratic British tradition , reconcile themselves to the decision of the majority . their view now be that we should get on with Brexit and make it a clean break with Brussels to prevent a further decade of trench warfare tear Britain apart . that apply more specifically to the Conservative Party , which must end its internal European schism or fall apart . Theresa May should remember the fate of David Cameron and ensure that Brexit really do mean Brexit - and within a much short time-span than two year . trade with Europe , like the rest of the world , be up for negotiation . otherwise , there be nothing to negotiate . l this article be first publish on Reaction.life .

UK need to Brex-celerate I WAS please to learn that Brexit Secretary David Davis will this week order go-slow Whitehall mandarin to get ready for Brexit . they have certainly run out of excuse . what the Remainers forget be the majority of people in this country vote for Brexit and it be go to happen , whether they like it or not . as soon as we be free from the EU ' S shackle , the well . other EU country will follow in our footstep - they have just be too scare to stand up and say so . it may be a long , hard battle for us but it will be easy for other in the future and be one reason why the EU have probably make it so difficult for us to leave .

can EU Hurry UP ? ; PM demand non-stop Brexit talk to end deadlock BREXIT @card@ Theresa May have call on the EU to agree to non-stop talk to end the Brexit stalemate . the PM want face-to-face Brussels negotiation to move from one week a month to roll weekly session until the deadlock be break . it also emerge last night that the next round of talk , set to start on September @card@ , may be delay a week so Mrs May can lobby key EU leader in the margin of a UN summit in New York that week . talk stall over EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier ' s refusal to open trade talk until Brexit Secretary David Davis agree to a divorce bill of up to Â£80billion . yesterday embarrass Mr Barnier backtrack on his threat to use negotiation to ` ` educate ' ' UK voter on Brexit ' S consequence . he insist he have not mean to single us out , tweet : ` ` Brexit = occasion to explain single market benefit in all country , incl my own .

we can get Brit trade on a roll like Swiss first thing first . Eighty-five per cent of us vote for party that pledge to leave the EU . the party that want a rerun - Lib Dems , Greens and SNP - all lost ground . there have never be a more Brexit-friendly Commons . what kind of Brexit , though ? be there now a majority in Parliament for a so-called ` ` soft Brexit ' ' , in which we end up be boss about by EU judge ? might Europhile Conservative and Labour MP leave us with a Brexit that happen in name only ? no . that option have never be on the table . as Donald Tusk , the President of the European Council , say : ` ` the only real alternative to a hard Brexit be no Brexit . ' ' and ` ` no Brexit ' ' be not an alternative when more than @card@ per cent of MP have be elect for party that promise to implement the referendum . ` ` Hard Brexit ' ' do n't mean refuse to work with our EU ally . on the contrary , most leaver want an open and global UK , in which we maintain our existing EU tie . so what be our option ? we could have a simple trade deal with the EU , like South Korea . there would be no ongoing budget contribution , and we ' d have total control of our immigration policy . but our export to the EU , especially in financial service , might drop and we ' d struggle to keep the current border-free deal with Ireland . at the other extreme , we could get a Norway-style deal , inside the common market but outside the political institution . we ' d get back control of farming , fishing , trade and citizenship right . but we ' d have to accept free movement on something close to the current term and pay into the EU budget . worse , we ' d have to take every new Brussels regulation . both of these option be good than where we be now . but we should aim high . in between the two be Switzerland , which have a kind of partial membership of the single market . it do not accept the ruling of the Euro-court but copy many of them through domestic legislation . it have many more trade deal than have the EU , include with big economy like China and Japan . Switzerland pay a small sum to Brussels - around a sixth as much per head as we do . EU and Swiss national have reciprocal work right but must have job to go to . importantly , the Swiss be not oblige to keep give benefit right to EU national whenever the European Court decide to extend them . I ca n't help notice the Swiss be do well . they be the secondrichest people on Earth and , the UN say , the second-happiest . they export more than four time as much per head to the EU as we do . their company be worldbeating : NestlÃ© and Novartis , Rolex and Swatch , Glencore and UBS . we co-found the European Free Trade Association ( EFTA ) with the Swiss back in @card@ . resume our seat there would n't be soft or hard Brexit . it would be global Brexit , extend our trade link with Europe and the whole world . be n't EFTA a compromise all side could live with ? lDaniel Hannan be a Conservative MEP and the author of what next : how to get the Best from Brexit

Friday ' S deal give Theresa May what she need - not for Brexit itself but for her political survival . but this be not about any politician ' S career . this be about our country ' S future . very soon we will be hear more lame excuse about why the country ca n't have the freedom it vote for in large number than we have ever vote for anything . if Mrs May ca n't make Brexit a reality then it be time for her to call the removal man into Downing Street and make way for someone who can . we be sick of see a British Prime Minister get down on her knee before Brussels . why be the border between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland ever such a deal-breaker ? the wealthy country in Europe , Norway - which be not in the EU - share a non-hard border with Sweden , which be in the EU . if the non-EU Norwegians and the EU Swede can manage an open border , then it should never have be beyond the wit of the UK and Ireland to work out a border that suit everyone . but , of course , there be many people who relish see Brexit falter and fail . there be foreign politician such as little Leo Varadkar , the puffed-up Irish premier , who actively enjoy see a British PM squirm . cynical soul and there be cynical soul closer to home , like Labour , who view Brexit as a blunt instrument with which to beat the wicked Tory . and it all look a bit too much for Mrs May . I do not doubt her essential decency , patriotism and sense of duty . but even after Friday , I have come to doubt her ability to get Brexit do . I doubt her ability to say to Brussels : ` ` bog off . ' ' why do we crawl to these creeps ? the UK be the second-largest contributor to the EU . we have pour billion into the gravy train . like a bitter dump boyfriend , the ruffle feather of Michel Barnier , Donald Tusk and Jean-Claude Juncker be understandable . but our people - free , democratic citizen of a country that have not bend the knee to any foreign invader for @card@ year - vote to leave . and that be what must happen . the Brexit denier try to make it complicated . but it be really , really not complicate . it be as brutally simple as can be . the British people either get the real Brexit they vote for or receive the message that their vote mean nothing . and democracy no long matter in this country . I ask the BBC , Tony Blair , Nick Clegg , the House of Lords , Keir Starmer , Vince Cable , Jeremy Corbyn , Bob Geldof and all the rest of the Brexit denier - do you really want to send that message to the British people ? it would be a very dangerous message to send .

Brexit debate ' S back with bang if you think the debate over Brexit and Scottish independence have go away , think again . we have a fortnight ' s lull while our politician go to ground for the festive period - doubtless plot their next move as they tuck into their turkey . yesterday , Nicola Sturgeon ease us back into the debate for @card@ , where this complex , multi-pronged debate will be back in full swing within day . in essence , she suggest indyref2 could be on hold for at least two year until after the Brexit process have play out . but despite some kerfuffle surround her comment , a close inspection reveal she actually say little more than she have in @card@ . the First Minister confirm in plain language than she have previously that indyref2 would be off the table in the short-term - but only if there be a ` ` soft ' ' Brexit . by ` ` soft ' ' , she mean Britain keep full membership of the European single market . this be oppose to a ` ` hard ' ' Brexit favour by Eurosceptic Tory - mean out of the single market , but with full control of immigration . opponent leap on Ms Sturgeon ' s comment as evidence she be retreat from her previous claim that indyref2 be ` ` highly likely ' ' . but in reality , we be where we be before Christmas . twitter addict Ms Sturgeon take to social medium to clarify that she reckon there be more chance of another referendum than a soft Brexit . so , we ' re back where we start . expect many more of these political riddle in the come day , week and month , as politician of all creed survey the constitutional chaos and try their damnedest not to commit to anything . Theresa May be due to make an EU speech any day now , hopefully shed at least some light on her tactic . crucially , we have no idea how she intend to balance our trade link with Europe - where leader insist free movement of people must remain - with her desire to regain full control of our border . as Ms Sturgeon rightly say yesterday , the ball be firmly in the PM ' S court .

Deputy Governor Sharon Donnery yesterday say : ` ` the agreement reach between UK and EU negotiator last week be to be welcome . ` ` but Brexit continue to pose a major risk to the Irish economy give that any final deal be still subject to continued negotiation which will be both significant and complex . ' ' the top banker add : ` ` in the absence of a final trade deal , disruption to supply chain be also a possibility , with many firm currently use the UK as a land bridge for transport good here . ` ` any change to transport route or increase border wait time might mean a knock-on increase in price for Irish shopper . ` ` high level of indebtedness in many Irish firm may deter investment and leave them vulnerable to any economic downturn or unable to raise the finance require to alter business model post-Brexit .

Foster insist that her party ` ` will not accept any form of regulatory divergence ' ' that separate the North from the rest of the UK . why the stance adopt by the DUP should have surprise May or anyone else involve in the negotiation be a complete mystery in itself . Leo finally give his speech over three hour later , say he be ` ` surprised and disappointed ' ' at the British government . the day have come full circle . a workable compromise on the border , post-Brexit , have to be find and quickly as the clock be now tick down to the European Council summit next week . the DUP be only one party - and one party must not be allow to torpedo a vital deal which be crucial to the future of the island . our government must stand firm on Brexit and ensure there be no hard border . but after the deal-and-no-deal shenanigan yesterday , we be now border on a total mess .

PM must stem Brexit strategy betrayal fear Reports that Theresa May have manage to frustrate even the Queen be the final confirmation the nation be officially feed up with be tell : ` ` Brexit mean Brexit . ' ' so , the good news . the Prime Minister now plan to give a speech set out the government ' s vision for leave in the New year . which could end the fear that the government be not reveal its strategy because it do not have one . give most speech have to include actual sentence , there be a great deal of excitement about what Mrs May might say . but the less good news I hear , be that very little work be go on at the moment in No10 to prepare for the speech . the Brexit department be still work on its review of how leaving will affect different sector of the economy , but it be also pour considerable effort into stop Tory MP from get too agitate . one source say : ` ` for a lot of people in our party , the sense of betrayal over the year about what they ' ve be tell the EU will be like and what the reality have turn out to be be so great that they think they ' re go to be betray again by Brexit . ' ' Mrs May have be work hard on the Remainers in her party too . a meeting in No10 last week with prominent pro-EU MP ( not include Nicky Morgan , naturally , after her Trousergate comment ) be ` ` well-tempered ' ' . the Prime Minister can afford to be relax about this group of Remoaners , as they do n't have a clear leader to challenge her . there have be a few grumble that Mrs May be n't spend enough time in the Commons charming backbencher , but most MP accept that she be busy travel to meet foreign leader to get them onside ahead of a very test @card@ . charming European counterpart be far more important than charming lonely backbencher . ' she do n't understand her power to set the Brexit tone ' so everything be calm in Westminster - for the moment . this mean there be very little pressure on the Prime Minister to reveal very much detail at all about what Britain ' s arrangement for leave the EU will be . ` ` she could get away with say very little , ' ' say one Cabinet minister . indeed , the more she say , the hard her aide will have to work to stop a betrayal narrative take hold among eurosceptics who do n't feel she be go far enough . in fact , Tory eurosceptics seem far less concerned about what she ' ll say about Brexit than they do about how she ' ll say it . ` ` she do n't quite understand her power to set the tone about Brexit , ' ' say one senior conservative . ` ` at the moment the narrative that Brexit be bad and mean we ' re retreat from the world be take hold , but she ' S the Prime Minister and can give us a much more upbeat line . she should say Britain should be a more actively engage country in the world . ' ' whatever Brexit turn out to mean , Mrs May need to show her party that she believe it be good news for this country and the rest of the world too . and that she know what she ' s do . lIsabel Hardman be assistant editor of the Spectator .

good fit for Nic ' s EU report ? it ' S Labour ; Bid To SECURE Scotland ' S Future AS BREXIT Row GROWS Commentary the question that remain about the Scottish Government ' s Brexit paper be ` ` what ' s it for ? ' ' who be this document aim at ? who be it supposed to inform or impress or persuade ? it ' S clearly not intend to reach the UK Government . they either know this stuff already or they simply do n't care . they use to care . when Theresa May be Home Secretary she campaign against leave the EU because it would destroy job , damage business and weaken national security . now she be do all she can to make it happen . David Davis , her Brexit Secretary , never care . he be always a Brexiteer . he always say it would be a piece of cake and a year and a half of confront the truth have n't do a thing to change his mind . anyway , we ' ve already see how little Mr Davis care for fact and figure . at one time he be tell MP that his department have prepare dozen of report , cover gyn the impact of Brexit on every area of British industry ` ` in excruciating detail ' ' . then they be all go . all he have to show the Commons be a few page of stuff lift off the Internet . it ' S very unlikely that Scottish Government report , spell out how Brexit be go to cut Â£2,300 from the pocket of every man , woman and child , will make the UK Government change course . they know all that already . so be it aim at a Scots audience ? remember , Nicola Sturgeon be all about independence and , from the very moment Brexit be announce , she have use it as a lever to prise open a way into IndyRef2 . be she try to persuade Scots voter that Brexit will be so awful the only alternative be independence ? she ' S probably waste her time on that plan . Scotland vote almost @card@ in favour of Remain . the Remainers have n't change their mind . maybe the First Minister be try to reach out to soft Brexiteers who think a leave vote would be one in h f l the eye for Brussels Eurocrats with their straight banana legislation and never believe it would also blow up the economy . but leave voter do n't listen to all the advice about how disastrous Brexit would be before . they do n't believe it then , they probably wo n't believe it now and , anyway , most of them would see it as h d a price worth pay to end immigration . Ms Sturgeon say she want to ` ` change the narrative ' ' on immigration . yesterday ' S document spell out that , far from cost the economy , foreign worker bring in Â£10,400 a year each . Holyrood ' S Brexit Minister Mike Russell say Scotland ` ` ca n't do without ' ' immigrant which be a bleak admission but it wo n't persuade the Brexiteers who fear foreigner more than economic collapse . anyway , Ms Sturgeon ' S fact cut both way . yesterday ' S document show EU country be by far our big international trading partner , take @card@ per cent of all Scots good . that be a seriously big deal and anything that damage that relationship be clearly bad news fb d h for job and the economy . the document also say that @card@ per cent - very nearly two third of all Scots export - go to the rest of the UK . it ' S not long ago that the First Minister and her mate be tell us that leave the UK would be just fine . she quote Treasury figure , but when the Treasury say independence would be a disaster , she ignore them . no , this document be a letter to Jeremy Corbyn - or those close to him . it ' s an attempt to persuade Labour that they have a duty to act like an opposition and oppose the ` ` hard-Brexit wing of the Tory party .

' ' Sir John warn that a full Brexit deal could take up to five year to negotiate . and he say the chance of there be no agreement within Article @card@ ' s two-year deadline be ` ` very high ' ' . he say fail to deliver on expectation will only ` ` sow further distrust between politics and the public ' ' and it would be ` ` well to underplay than overplay ' ' them .

Sir John also say a hard Brexit without any trade deal would be ` ` high risk ' ' and threaten the social security system and the NHS . and he say Britain post-Brexit will also be more dependent on ` ` a less predictable , less reliable ' ' US under Donald Trump . No10 do not respond directly to the criticism . a spokesman say : ` ` we have a clear plan to get the good deal for the UK and be go to get on with the job of deliver it .

TOETAL RECALL ; Tories in Birmingham Steely May PUTS Her Foot Down ON EU PM vow to win back UK ' S law full control over immigration we ' ll snare Brexit trade deal Theresa May yesterday give the EU a steel toecapped kick - as she promise to regain full control over immigration and UK law . she launch her first Tory conference as leader with a tub-thumping speech in which she set out her two Brexit red line - then dare EU leader to throw-up self-defeat trade barrier against us . Brussels have repeatedly warn the UK can not have continued access to the EU single market without accept its free movement principle too . but the PM , who fittingly have stroll on to the Birmingham stage in a pair of steel-capped shoe , leave no doubt that she would not be toe the Brussels line . she say : ` ` let me be clear . we be not leave the European union only to give up control of immigration again . ` ` and we be not leave only to return to the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice . ` ` the process we be about to begin be not about negotiate all of our sovereignty away again . ' ' she delight her audience by say it be high time to show some faith in Britain . Mrs May say : ` ` let ' s ignore the pessimist , let ' s have the confidence in ourselves to go out into the world , secure trade deal , win contract , generate wealth and create job . Let ' s show the country we mean business . ' ' she also warn she may have to make some compromise on the road to Brexit , as every negotiation require ` ` some give and take ' ' . the PM declare she will begin formal Brexit negotiation by the end of March next year - tee up a two year-long game of brinkmanship with the EU . trigger the maximum twoyear Article @card@ process by March @card@ will mean Britain be independent from the EU by March @card@ @card@ . Mrs May signal she would fiercely oppose a legal bid to force a parliamentary vote on trigger Article @card@ . she say : ` ` they ' re not try to get Brexit right , they ' re try to kill it by delay it . ` ` they ' re insult the intelligence of the British people and that ' S why next week the Attorney General himself , Jeremy Wright , will act for the government and resist them in the court . ' ' the PM ' S critic claim her formula mean she be aim for a hard Brexit and total clean break from the EU . but Mrs May insist the idea of a ` ` trade-off ' ' between control immigration and trading openly with the rest of Europe ` ` be the wrong way of look at thing ' ' . instead of sign up Britain to an existing model , Mrs May say our future relationship would be ` ` an agreement between an independent , sovereign United Kingdom and the European Union ' ' . as well as trade , it will also include law enforcement and counter-terrorism cooperation . in a move that could infuriate other EU leader , the PM put Britain ' s world-beating counterterrorism intelligence expertise on the table for the first time . GCHQ , MI5 and MI6 ' s spy network will now be a bargaining chip for Britain in the negotiation - with country such as France and Belgium rely heavily on them to warn of impending terror attack . Mrs May ' S vision be her answer to pressure from MP and business to start define how our EU walkaway will work , have so far say little more than ` ` Brexit mean Brexit ' ' . she win a standing ovation from the conference hall and strong praise from pro- Brexit Tory MP . the fierce opposition she face come from battle a runny nose that leave her sound full of cold . at one point she be force to break out the tissue in the middle of her live TV performance . speak after Mrs May , Brexit Secretary David Davis compare the Brexit challenge to the daunting task face by new Tory PM Margaret Thatcher in @card@ . recall her battle to drag Britain back to economic health in the 1980s , Mr Davis say : ` ` they say ' it ca n't be do ' . ` ` we prove them wrong then and we ' ll prove them wrong again . ' ' but Tory and Labour MP campaigning for keep close link to the EU be unconvinced . Exbusiness minister Anna Soubry say trigger Brexit as early as March ` ` trouble me hugely ' ' . she add : ` ` the idea that we hold the card and we be go to get anything like as good as we have now be rubbish . we do n't hold the card , the EU do . ' ' EU chief praise Mrs May for name the date . but EU Council chief Donald Tusk warn Brussels be equally determine to dig in to get what it want over Brexit . he tweet in response to the Birmingham speech : ` ` PM May ' S declaration bring welcome clarity on start of Brexit talk . once Art @card@ ' S trigger , EU27 will engage to safeguard its interest .

Bend Macron ' s ear at the Brexit table Emmanuel MACRON will arrive in Britain late next week for an Anglo-French summit . the French President will bring with him half a dozen of his top team . they will sit down with Theresa May and several senior Cabinet minister at Sandhurst , the officer training college that both Princes William and Harry attend . the focus , appropriately , will be on defence . the agenda span everything from terrorism to Macron ' s campaign against ` ` fake news ' ' . it should be the perfect setting for Mrs May to bend Macron ' s ear about Brexit . the whole event be a reminder of the importance of the Anglo-French security relationship which will matter long after Brexit be do . nine key issue but Mrs May ' s ability to lobby Macron will be hurt by the fact that the UK Government still have n't agree on precisely what kind of Brexit deal it want . Chancellor Philip Hammond might be justify in complain that the EU have n't be clear either . but the onus be on Britain to explain how it want the future relationship to work . before Christmas , the Brexit inner Cabinet and the Cabinet discuss the final deal they want to reach with the EU for the first time . the meeting , though , be more a chance for everyone to have their say than an opportunity to take decision . at the first Cabinet meeting of this year , Brexit be not on the agenda . it be not on next week ' S either . so there ' ll be no collectively agree policy in the next few week . however , I understand that the Brexit inner Cabinet will have a two-hour meeting next week to begin the process of thrash out the UK position . member of the committee expect there will be three of these meeting before the PM give her big speech set out what the UK want , which be now expect next month . one of those involve in prepare for these meeting caution that we should not expect much to be sort at next week ' s session of the inner Cabinet . ` ` some issue be so large they ca n't be resolve at a single meeting , ' ' I ' m tell . I understand the aim be to get a ` ` general sense of the collective approach ' ' on nine key issue , rather than to agree every detail . those in the Cabinet who favour a more gradual Brexit think thing be come their way . they believe that ` ` the practical reality of Ireland , what the EU will offer and the desire to avoid crash out without a deal ' ' will push thing their way . but those who favour the UK do its own thing more quickly believe the balance have shift in their favour with the conversion of the Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson to their cause . but Mrs May need to make up her mind quickly . for until she do , the UK ca n't push for its own preferred solution . the lack of a detailed government prospectus for Brexit be also create a vacuum that politician hunt for a purpose , such as Nigel Farage and Tony Blair , be fill with their talk of a second referendum . Mrs May have never take decision quickly . but this vacuum be damage the government at home and abroad . the sooner she say what Britain want , the well . lJames Forsyth be political editor of the Spectator
with back of new Prez , Brexit success be a Don deal ` ` Trump change almost everything , ' ' declare one Cabinet minister who support Remain but now think Brexit will be a success . their argument be that the arrival of the most unexpected US President in history have shake thing up ... and to Britain ' S advantage . those who know the new President well tell me that Trump be emotionally invest in Brexit . he feel that it and his own victory be part of the same movement . despite his alarmingly protectionist instinct , which be set out again in his speech yesterday , Trump do want a trade pact with the UK . this , and the trade offer from other country , be a reminder that Britain wo n't be isolate and alone after Brexit . Trump be tell people he want to get personally involve in negotiate the US/UK deal . I understand his team have do more work on it than it have for any other potential agreement . but Trump ' S election have also make the UK more important to Europe . Trump ' S worryingly ambivalent attitude to Nato and his desire for good relation with Vladimir Putin ' s Russia at almost any price , mean that the UK be more important to the continent ' s security than it have be for 60-odd year . Trump have also reverse US policy to the EU . for @card@ year , Washington have support European integration . but Trump do n't . he and his team prefer strong nation state to big , supranational organisation . the new President act like he want the EU to fall apart . in a provocative act , he be plan to make a Brexit-backer the US ' s ambassador to the EU and be predict that other country will follow this one out the door . this hostility have rattle EU leader . when Theresa May speak to Jean-Claude Juncker and Donald Tusk , the president of the EU Commission and Council , after her Brexit speech on Tuesday , they both bring up Trump ' s comment about other country leave the EU . they both stress how pleased they be that Mrs May have make clear that she want the EU to succeed . the respectful EU reaction to her speech - Tusk compare it to Churchill ' s vision of Britain and Europe - open up the possibility of a sensible Brexit deal . this would see Britain outside the EU but bolster it on security as it try to deal with the Islamist terrorist threat and Russian aggression . the relationship would be underpin by continued , close trading link between the UK and the EU . a good Brexit deal be in both side ' interest . as even the guy who like to play the hardman in EU negotiation , the German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schauble , admit , a breakdown in the Brexit talk , ` ` would be a disaster for all of us ' ' . with Britain not try to stay in the EU internal market , the two side - with sufficient political will - should be able to negotiate a free trade deal . add in the EU ' s desire for continued access to the City ' s financial market , as reveal in a leak of a meeting between Brussels ' chief negotiator Michel Barnier and senior MEPs , and you can see the outline of an agreement . when Trump start run for President , he think he have only a ten per cent chance of win the Republican nomination . he privately quip that his tilt at the presidency would , at least , increase his speak fee . but now he be the man in the Oval Office . who know how this truth-is-stranger-thanfiction tale will end , and the Trump presidency could go disastrously wrong , as his angry inauguration address remind us . but if the UK can secure free trade deal with the EU and the US , this country will be in a great position to head out into the world and secure a more prosperous future for itself .

blow for EU ... and a chance for the PM ONALD B Donald Trump ' s ` ` Brexit ' ' presidential triumph be a stinging slap in the face for Hillary Clinton and the political elite who think they run America . but it be also a potentially lethal blow to the blinkered boss of the European Union - and a unique advantage for British PM Theresa May . in Berlin and Brussels there be cry of ` ` calamity ' ' and ` ` emergency ' ' as the shock result come in . ` ` the self-destruction of the West continue , ' ' scream one newspaper . but Europe ' S crisis be an opportunity for Britain - and Theresa May seize it yesterday as one of the first to congratulate Trump and stress our ` ` special relationship ' ' with America . Trump be a fan of Britain and its open market . he be the only senior American to reject Barack Obama ' s ill-judged warning we would go to ` ` the back of the queue ' ' on trade if we leave the EU . in stark contrast , the presidentelect support Brexit in the referendum and vow Britain will be ` ` treat fantastically ' ' if we quit . indeed it be Trump who put the word ` ` Brexit ' ' into the global dictionary as a definition of voter defiance . Britain an USA. . few in the US have hear the word until it be pop into his mouth by Nigel Farage who be constantly at his side . Trump promise ` ` Brexit time ten ' ' . his victory would be ` ` Brexit plus , plus , plus ' ' . now he have put wind in the sail of another insurgent , French populist Marine le Pen , who threaten a ` ` Frexit ' ' next spring . like Trump , she be an outsider , write off as a potential president . victory in Paris would trigger convulsion in Germany where Angela Merkel face an election backlash over mass immigration , and in Holland where Rightwingers be on the rampage . Le Pen want to follow Britain out of the EU . defeat for Merkel would remove the lynchpin of EU political power . the new White House incumbent have warn EU leader he will cut America ' s contribution to Nato force unless they cough up more cash for their own defence . however he respect Britain as one of the few country which meet defence spending target . this be where we can be a vital ally . Mrs May will be among the first Western leader invite to the Oval Office to meet the President after he take over in January . for all his bravado , Trump will be stun by his new responsibility as the 45th US President and leader of the free world . he be untested as a politician and statesman and will need all the experienced friend he can get . he would not be human if he do not pounce on a chance to strike up a valuable relationship with a try and trust ally , especially someone who speak English . Mrs May have the advantage as a new PM of start with a clean diplomatic sheet . Downing Street would have assume a Clinton victory , provide continuity in international affair . Trump seem by comparison to be volatile , impulsive and alarmingly inexperienced . but while predecessor David Cameron call Trump ` ` divisive , stupid and wrong ' ' over his plan to temporarily ban Muslim from enter America , Mrs May have never utter a word of criticism against the billionaire tycoon . unlike President Obama , who barely conceal his distaste for Britain ' s colonial record , Trump have invest million here with two controversial new golf course in Aberdeenshire . SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon , who sack him as a business ambassador for Scotland , have to eat her word yesterday and insist tie would remain ` ` deep and enduring ' ' . be asset to Mrs May know it be vital to cement good relation with America ' s new Commander-in-Chief . Trump have cause alarm in Europe with his eagerness to talk to Russian leader Vladimir Putin over Syria , the Middle East Ukraine . Trump fan V Syr and Uk it will be Mrs May ' s task to rebuild once-indestructible tie between the UK and US fracture by the Iraq War and sideline during the Obama presidency . Britain may no longer be a world power but the White House be fill with tribute to the UK , include a presidential desk carve from the oak timber of a British warship . until recently , a bust of Sir Winston Churchill be keep on their desk . President Obama consign it to an outside office . Tory PM Margaret Thatcher have a remarkable special relationship with successive US Presidents , especially Ronald Reagan , help persuade Russia to ` ` tear down ' ' the Berlin Wall . indeed , it be the Kremlin that dub her ` ` the Iron Lady ' ' . many Tory be already hail Mrs May as the new Iron Lady . and the election of the unpredictable Trump give her a golden opportunity to show her diplomatic skill . we be a huge asset to the US , whoever be President . our remarkable intelligence service and a place at the UN top table make Britain an important soft power on the world stage . who know , we might even persuade Trump to put Churchill ' S bust back in the Oval Office ? Britain be an asset to USA..Trump be a fan
Brexit strategy the Brexit shambles roll on and on . yesterday UK Prime Minister Theresa May come up against an unlikely rival - a billionaire former model . Gina Miller be part of a group that beat the UK Government in a landmark case over Brexit . May have plan to trigger Article @card@ of the Lisbon Treaty follow the June result as early as March next year and recently declare Britain would be out of the EU by April @card@ . however follow a three-day hearing by three senior judge it be rule that May could not start the process of leave the EU without the consent of MP , mean it will now go to a parliamentary vote . expert say it could derail plan to leave the EU . but the implication for Ireland if Brexit go ahead remain as serious as ever . Taoiseach Enda Kenny have be do the round at Brexit fallout talk this week to hear from people affect by the crisis . some critic have dismiss the forum as ` ` talk shop ' ' - while Kenny maintain the talk have be useful and informative . he must now focus on stand up for Ireland ' S interest and come up with proper plan to protect the country . conference of interested group wo n't cut it - we need some meaningful proposition . with the prospect of a hard Border , we need to move beyond the consequence of Brexit and look at alternative . amid all the uncertainty , failure to plan for Brexit would Border on madness .
what kind of Brexit be this ? the programme offer by Theresa May in Florence yesterday admit that a negotiate Brexit can not possibly be achieve inside the punish two-year timetable of the Article @card@ process . and it plead for extra time - another two year or so - when we will have to pay to stay inside Europe , without actually be part of it . the Prime Minister offer to buy her way back in to a temporary ` ` transition ' ' so British business can continue their free access to EU market , but we will no longer have any say over the term and condition of that marketplace . she also speak warmly of join up to the EU ' s new border and security plan - the threatened EU army which be such a bogeyman of the Brexit referendum . at the same time she offer assurance about the future of EU citizen live in the UK . there be no real detail and certainly nothing that would satisfy negotiator on the other side . but she be clear that the EU citizen right would be decide by British court who would be allow to take European Court judgement into account . that ' S unlikely to satisfy the Commission , who want to see the European court as the final arbiter of dispute . the government remain uncertain in its own mind all these thing be matter of negotiation but this much be clear . Mrs May have change her tone out of all measure - again . from be a staunch anti-Brexit campaigner who say that leave the EU would wreck the British economy and weaken our security , she have transform into someone who now look forward to leave with ` ` enthusiasm ' ' and ` ` excitement ' ' . from staunchly stick to the notion that ` ` Brexit mean Brexit ' ' and ` ` no deal be good than a bad deal ' ' , she have move to believe that Brexit mean hang about by the exit for a couple of year while a deal - any deal - be conclude . in her speech , Mrs May say the UK have ` ` never feel totally at home be in the European Union ' ' . but have n't she forgotten the majority of Scot who - let ' s not forget - vote to remain in the EU ? try find some ` ` enthusiasm ' ' and ` ` excitement ' ' amongst those voter , Prime Minister . yesterday ' S speech have reveal , once again , that the government remain uncertain in its own mind about what Brexit actually mean . at the same time they have finally realise that everybody else be right and it ' s a lot more complicated than they think . but , in the end , it hardly matter . whatever bid Mrs May make , it be for the @card@ rival government of the EU to decide if they will accept it . the United Kingdom use to be an equal partner in Europe . now we be on our own .

Donald Tusk , the European Council President , say the only choice be hard Brexit and no Brexit , and that he would be delight if Britain change its mind about leave . the thinking seem to be that bad economic news might send this country scurry back to the EU . a less extreme version of this theory can be find in our own parliament . one former Government minister tell me this week that he think that when the supposed ` ` economic reality come into focus ' ' , Britain would end up go for a single-market , EU-lite deal . but the deal that Britain seek must be the right one in the long term , not a short-term fix . agree to a deal where Britain simply accept rule it have no role in make would be a disaster . ` ` you ca n't run the City of London simply cut and paste in French regulation , ' ' warn one senior City figure . I be tell that the Bank of England Governor , Mark Carney , be particularly concern about this , give the size of the UK ' s banking sector . inside government , they hope there will be a ` ` vote of confidence ' ' in Brexit Britain in the next week or so . they expect that follow Business Secretary Greg Clark ' s visit to Japan this week , Nissan will announce that it Will build its new Qashqai in Sunderland . this will be a huge relief to the government . it will show that the British car industry be n't be write off by Brexit . insider be reluctant to confirm whether the government promise to compensate Nissan if the EU do introduce tariff on British-made car . but one well-place source tell me that the government be sufficiently sure that there wo n't be tariff either way , that it could make ` ` robust assurance , but be fully confident they wo n't be call in ' ' . EU must show be outside hurt the current hard-line statement of EU leader be regard by the Brexit minister as just noise . ' ' the punishment talk do n't make any sense . we ' ll get a bloody nose , but they ' ll be bad off than we be , ' ' one of them tell me . but the EU be , at heart , a political project , not an economic one . it would be dangerous to imagine that cool economic logic will win out . there will be a desire to show that being outside the club hurt . however , the EU ' s most important political project be the single currency . the Euro might have bring economic misery to large part of southern Europe , but the EU be determine to keep it go whatever the economic - and human - cost . a hard Brexit , with no deal on the EU ' s access to the City of London and vice-versa , would endanger the single currency as London be - effectively - the Eurozone ' s financial and banking capital . as the head of the large American bank , Jamie Dimon , of JP Morgan , have warn : ` ` Brexit increase fivefold the risk of the Eurozone fail in the next ten year . ' ' ultimately , it will be the EU ' s desire to protect its flagship project that will bring about a sensible , negotiate Brexit . James Forsyth be political editor of the Spectator

First Minister Nicola Sturgeon warn the economy ` ` will take a hit ' ' no matter what but insist remain in the trade bloc be the least damaging option . Official analysis state our economy would lose Â£12.7billion by @card@ - Â£2,300 per person , equivalent to a @card@ per cent fall in GDP - if Theresa May fail to strike a new deal and we shift to World Trade Organisation rule in a hard Brexit . Ms Sturgeon say Holyrood economist look at the ` ` only three realistic outcome ' ' of the split and vow to press for continued single market membership ` ` more loudly ' ' than ever ahead of the next EU talk in March . she add : ` ` the evidence we present today be clear - the good way to minimise the economic damage of Brexit be to stay inside the single market . it demonstrate beyond doubt that if Brexit be to proceed then stay in the single market be the only option that make sense . ' ' accord to the forecast , Scotland be set to lose @card@ per cent of GDP by @card@ - Â£4billion - even if we stay in the single market . it would mean a @card@ per cent drop in disposable income and a near three per cent slump in business investment . the Scotland ' s place in Europe : People Jobs and Investment paper also say a Free Trade Agreement similar to one use by Canada would shrink Scotland ' s economy by @card@ per cent - Â£9billion .

Labour risk crisis if it vote Remain ON Monday at midnight , Jeremy Corbyn ' S Labour Party will make its first big post-election mistake . its MP will be whip to vote against the EU Withdrawal Bill . up to now , Labour have manage to have its cake and eat it on Brexit . at the last election , Labour MP in Brexit-backing seat could say their party be n't against it , that it have vote for Article @card@ . meanwhile , in Remain-voting area , Labour hoover up vote from those angry about Britain leave the EU . this strategy enable Labour to keep hold of nearly all of its seat in heavily Brexit area while at the same time get prosperous metropolitan voter , who would be hammer by Corbyn ' s tax policy , to vote for them in a Brexit protest . remarkably , @card@ per cent of Financial Times reader vote Labour despite Corbyn ' s hostility to the City and high earner . but by oppose the withdrawal bill , Labour be endanger this coalition . as one excited Tory tell me , they will now be able to attack Labour for vote against leave the EU . a significant number of Labour MP with Brexit-backing constituency be worry about this . the Tories who liaise with Labour Brexiteers think as many as @card@ Labour MP could defy their leader on Monday . so why be Labour take this risk ? the first reason be that this be a great opportunity for them to cause trouble for the government . with several Tory MP unhappy about bit of the bill , they have a chance of defeat the government on at least some amendment . secondly , there be those on the Labour side who think this bill simply give the Tory government too much power . but the third reason be the most important . they do n't want a new pro-European , pro-single market party to be form . with the Tory in turmoil , perhaps the big threat to Corbyn ' s chance of make it to No10 be the creation of a new centre party . it would draw more vote from Labour than from any other party . this new party would have no trouble raise money - some deep-pocketed individual have privately make clear they would be prepare to support it . but no politician have be prepare to make the leap . Corbyn and his team want to deny pro-single market Labour MP an excuse to jump - hence the party ' s softening position on Brexit . but with the Brexit talk turn nasty , Labour ' S position be a risk . the EU side be ramp up the rhetoric - note their distinctly undiplomatic attack on David Davis this week . if this continue , the public will likely side with their own government rather than an EU that look like it be try to bully Britain into hand over ten of billion of pound . one minister closely involve with the withdrawal bill tell me : ` ` I want Barnier and Juncker to keep do what they be do . ` ` it will either force Merkel and the other to make Barnier and Juncker move or shore up support for no-deal at home . ' ' at the heart of government , they remain confident there will be a deal in the end . one well-place source predict the EU will ultimately adopt a more reasonable position on the so-called divorce bill ` ` because some money be good than no money ' ' . yet this approach underestimate the risk of human error - that both side miscalculate and expect the other to back down , with the result that the talk collapse . for this reason , the government must make Britain as ready as possible for a no-deal scenario .

Ricky Hart Scunthorpe , North Lincs THE EU chief negotiator ' s claim that the member state will decide whether or not there have be ` ` significant progress ' ' on a Brexit deal be nonsense .

Brian Alden Bristol I be amaze at the way Theresa May be be ask to go by Labour ' S Jeremy Corbyn but even more amazed at the call for her to step down from member of her own party . she Won the election , even if her majority may not be the one she be hope for . the Tory MP who have turn tail and call for her to go should be ashamed for play right into the hand of the opposition . jean Norfolk Knottingley , West York THESE be test time as our democracy come under attack from those hell-bent on anarchy . now the ballot box have not temper their discontent , we must all stand strong . anarchist must not be allow to triumph over democracy .

Brexit really do mean Brexit , David the seemingly endless Christmas recess have do nothing for Brexit which continue to go as smoothly as a grand piano roll down a multi-storey car park . only last week Brexit Secretary David Davis be reveal to have write a very stiff letter to the Prime Minister , warn her that those flaming Euro-Johnnies be actually serious about do what they always say they would . show no shred of gratitude for all that our brave boy do to save them from themselves twice in the last century , the Europeans have actually be write to a range of British business , warn them of the impact of Brexit . this week she reveal she do n't like whisky and she have never drink Irn-Bru . Mr Davis whine : ` ` the EU have adopt a number of measure that put agreement or contract at risk of be terminate in the event of a no deal scenario and would require UK company to relocate to another member state . ' ' how bloody dare they ? Ms Marwick tweet proudly : ` ` Fizzy drink always give headache . be teenager before they fizzy drink . ' ' it must a blow when Louise ` ` that ' s what think . ' ' he add : ` ` some EU agency have publish guidance outline that the UK will become a third country when we stop be a Member State after @card@ . ` ` no wonder Mr Davis be disgust by this claim from the EU . the full horror of it can only be appreciate if you also understand that it ' S entirely true ! but it ' S even bad . the EU letter say that : ` ` compliance activity such as quality control of each batch of medicine before it be release on to the market would need to be base in the EU after exit . ` ` the Commission have issue similar unilateral statement on company law , civil justice , private international law , transport , and the breeding , transport and protection of live animal . ' ' to make a long story short , what the EU Commission have do be write to British business and tell them ` ` Brexit mean Brexit ' ' . it mean all that easy trading we have have for almost half a century be over . it mean that all the arrangement we have where a British driving licence be good in Portugal and Germany , or a British professional qualification would count in Latvia or a British aspirin could be sell in Poland be over . Holyrood Marwick , take to the but Mr Davis be not so much anger as disappoint by the fact that the EU say nothing at all about the fabulous deal we maybe , could , perhaps , theoretically , possibly get . this fabulous deal will so fabulous that all those arrangement will remain in place and we will continue to enjoy all benefit of be in EU while not be the EU . ` ` none of f have me my kid Mr Davis tell the Minister in his letter : ` ` these statement take account of the future relationship . ' ' well , be that really surprising ? after all , how many time have we hear that ` ` no deal be good than a bad deal ' ' ? how many time have we hear that Britain be ready to walk away alone into the wilderness rather than accept another moment of Euroslavery ? as the EU official spokesman ever have have be daughter reply : you comment : ` ` we be surprise that the UK be surprise that we be prepare for a scenario announce by the UK Government itself . ' ' but , to be fair , Mr Davis and his chum probably do n't realise that be what they have announce . they do now .
why be Royal Mail pander to the anti-Brexit bunch ? ; GIVE US A Stamp of APPROVAL ASKED if it would be issue a set of commemorative stamp to mark Brexit , the Royal Mail reply with a firm and distinctly snooty ` ` no ' ' . it have n't deign to give a reason . and yet the first new stamp it will issue in @card@ will commemorate Game of Thrones . a gripping television drama , to be sure , but also an American commercial product . after yesterday ' S outcry , with one senior Tory MP brand their decision ` ` inconsistent , irritate and annoy ' ' , many reasonable people assume Royal Mail would think again . how on Earth could the company justify its determination to ignore the large democratic vote in British history ? print a set would cost them no extra cash , and they have previously mark political event with commemorative issue . yet still , answer come there none . just a grim repetition of the original ` ` no ' ' . I think I know what ' s go on . like many creak British institution , Royal Mail - now private but infected from top to bottom with a public-sector mentality - be live in an escapist fantasy every bit as imaginary as the seven kingdom of Westeros in Game of Thrones . it ' S the parallel universe of the Remoaners , a ` ` safe space ' ' in which Brexit can be stop , even though the government have trigger Article @card@ , our formal notification of leave the EU . in well-heeled part of this country , university lecturer and yummy mummy rush to bookshop to buy how to stop Brexit by the freshly knight yesterday ' S man , Sir Nick Clegg . this silly book belong on the sciencefiction shelf next to author George RR Martin ' s game of Thrones novel . diehard Remainers , poor thing , really believe Clegg ' s claim that the referendum result can be sweep under the carpet . and they ' re encourage in this delusion by the yacht-hopping fantasist Tony Blair , whose grip on reality be become more tenuous by the minute . why be the Royal Mail - which have no problem decorate its stamp with Peppa Pig , Mr Men , ` ` sustainable fish ' ' or notable locomotive of Wales - pander to the doctrinaire anti-Brexit lobby ? no ! no ! no ! be it terrify of Twitter storm ? or be this just another symptom of its failure to engage with the modern world ? every time I go into my local Post Office I feel like I ' m visit a 1970s theme park , complete with eastern bloc-style queue and semi-comatose counter service . whatever the reason , Royal Mail need to change its mind . and there ' s still plenty of time - which be why the Sun be mount a campaign for stamp mark the Brexit we demand . you might ask : do it matter , give that we ' re definitely wave farewell to Brussels in March next year ? yes , it do matter . in @card@ the Royal Mail issue stamp to celebrate us join the common market , even though million of Briton oppose the move . as the referendum two year later - win by the Yes campaign with @card@ per cent of the vote - show , most people think the decision a necessary step in our national journey . now we be take another step - not in the opposite direction , but a step forward into a very different globalised world , in which we need the freedom to regulate our own business and negotiate our own trade deal . Foam-flecked Remoaners , who make up only a minority of those who vote to stay in the EU , will hate the stamp . well , tough . by the time we leave , we ' ll have have to put up with nearly three year of hissy fit , futile plot and crudely twisted reporting by the anti- Brexit BBC . but make no mistake about it : by then , the ` ` Stop Brexit ' ' movement will have fall apart , just as George Osborne ' s Project fear backfire and the news that blue passport come back cheer us rather than provoke outrage . when the Royal Mail do respect the will of the people and get on with print Brexit stamp , we will enjoy send them around the world to exhibit our pride in this great www.nation.No doubt some daft Remoaners will refuse to open their letter and create embarrassing scene in Post office , but let them enjoy their one last tantrum . like hyperactive child , they ' ll calm down when they run out of energy . the rest of us can afford to smile , not just at their antic but because we ' re begin an exciting new chapter in our island story . and that be indeed something to celebrate - by put the stamp of history on our mail . l Damian Thompson be associate editor of the Spectator . exciting new chapter

Brexit betrayal last night ' s Brexit defeat be a bitter humiliation for the government and a moment of shame for the Tory ` ` rebel ' ' . they have utterly compromise their own leader and Prime Minister , just day after her breakthrough last week and on the brink of the EU summit . and they have hand a victory to all those still bent on overturn the big democratic mandate in our history . the PM must find a solution . she and David Davis have to be able to negotiate our historic trade deal without fear Remainers in Parliament will kill it . but Brussels now know that europhile MP and peer , and an entirely self-interested Labour Party , be wait to pick any deal to piece and send the government back to try again . Britain back Brexit . MP vote overwhelmingly to carry it out . it should fall to the PM and Brexit Secretary to drive as hard a bargain as possible . but Brussels will now effectively be negotiate not with them but with the war faction of our Parliament . that ' S an impossible farce . Remainers dress this up as a battle for democracy . for most the real goal be to delay or halt Brexit or , fail that , ` ` soften ' ' it to meaninglessness . some EU nation be already champ at the bit to give us a tailor-made deal . we should be capitalise on that . but how can the government negotiate it with any focus now , while live in fear of more Remainer rebellion back home ?

' ' but Tory leader Ruth Davidson accuse Ms Sturgeon of use the EU talk as way to secure another chance of independence . she say : ` ` it ' S hard to escape the conclusion the SNP ' s Brexit plan be set up to fail - all so Nicola Sturgeon can find a reason to break up the UK . ` ` she talk about compromise , but in black and white in her own report be her true intention - independence in Europe . she have be use the Brexit issue to get to that point all along and the people of Scotland can see her manoeuvre for what it be . ` ` if she truly want the good Brexit deal , she should be pull together with other part of the UK , not try to split the country up .

' ' Talready without the First Minister unveil her shopping list of Brexit demand yesterday . under the plan , power over key area like agriculture , food and drink , fishing , the environment , family and international criminal law would be return from the EU and automatically hand to Holyrood . there would be new health power , allow EU citizen to use the NHS and Scot to access European service . and there would be continue cooperation over education and research . Ms Sturgeon want Holyrood to have control over employment law , union law , health and safety and consumer protection . but to stay in the single market , Scotland would have take over responsibility for freedom of movement , immigration , competition law , and social security so EU national could claim benefit here . and everything from financial service to phone , post and transport would have to be control by Holyrood so they could be guarantee to fit with EU requirement . the big problem be how Scotland could allow free movement of good and people without a hard border with England . Ms Sturgeon say : ` ` the UK Government already appear open a flexible approach to different sector of the economy , to Northern Ireland and Gibraltar . there be no reason why such flexibility should not apply to Scotland .

I ' m less and less clear in my own mind what these jamboree be about . certainly if the First Minister and her chum be say the sort of thing in Holyrood that they say at the conference in Glasgow last week , I doubt if many of my chum would bother to write it down . we ' re tell the SNP ' S conference be the large of any in the UK which be an indicator of the size and enthusiasm of Nicola Sturgeon ' S supporter . and just like all the other conference , Brexit hang over this one like a brood shadow but the contrast with what have go before could hardly be more clear . where the conservative decide that Brexit present an ideal opportunity to make official list of foreigner and ` ` shame ' ' business which employ them , Ms Sturgeon stress that those who choose to settle here be welcome and value . be the difference in tone be just one symptom of the Brexit division - an extra edge to the weapon which the SNP will use to revive their independence campaign . call me an old cynic if you like , but be it possible Prime Minister Theresa May be try to help the SNP out ? look to get have she write the jock off ? be she look for a way to get us off the book now that the oil have all but run out ? off I only ask because it book ? seem as if the UK Government be go out of its way to offend the Scot over Brexit . the Prime Minister say Scotland will be fully involve in prepare the Brexit negotiating position . but her Cabinet sub-committee on Brexit have no seat for David Mundell . you ' d think he might be qualify to represent Scottish interest - he be the only Scottish Tory MP and also , he be the actual , real-life Scotland Secretary . the Scotland Office website say he ` ` ensure Scottish interest be fully and effectively represent at the heart of the UK Government ' ' . but not in this case . Scottish Tory leader Ruth Davidson boast she have easy access to Brexit Secretary David Davis . his door be always open . he ' S ready to engage with the Scot . just not with David Mundell . and then there ' s Sunderland , home of the giant Nissan car plant which rely heavily on sale into the EU . it be the most efficient and productive plant the company have and hopeful that it might be choose to produce the new Qashqai . Sunderland vote to get out of the EU by @card@ per cent , virtually a mirror image of the Scottish vote . but , not to worry . last week Mrs May have Nissan boss round for a cup of coffee to assure them they would be ` ` shield ' ' from any impact of Brexit . it ' S not yet clear what she have in mind . there have be talk of the taxpayer picking pay any additional EU trade tariff on car from Sunderland . it ' S the lunatic position of a government determine to get out of the single market , pay an international corporation to keep job they would happily maintain for free if we be in the single market . Sunderland could even be give a new status as a kind of ` ` bonded warehouse ' ' , a little bit of the EU in the North East of England . Sunderland could become the colonial Hong Kong of Tyne and Wear . that ' s their reward for vote to leave Europe but Scotland , which vote to stay , be get no special deal . ` ` Brexit mean Brexit , ' ' say Mrs May . ` ` we will negotiate as one United Kingdom and leave as one United Kingdom . ' ' except for Sunderland , obviously . and this uncertainty go further than industry . just a month after the EU vote , the Home Office launch a new visa scheme for foreign student . Masters Degree student from abroad will be able to stay on an extra six month in order to find a job in the UK once their course be complete - but only if they study at the University of Oxford , the University of Cambridge , the University of Bath , or Imperial College London . may us the do you notice anything about those respected educational institution ? something they have in common ? like where they be on the map ? those university be select because of the ` ` consistently low level of visa refusal ' ' for student seek to study there . maybe it ' s different for St Andrew and Glasgow and Edinburgh . maybe lot of potential illegal immigrant pretend to be rocket scientist at Scottish university . it would be stupid to pretend Brexit have not exacerbate the political divide between Scotland and England . look at the map with every single council area in Scotland voting for Europe and hardly any south of that very firm border . Nicola Sturgeon ' s decision to make ` ` inclusion the guiding principle of everything we do ' ' while the conservative want to make list of foreigner , could hardly be more starkly divide . so far it have n't impact on support for independence . with a @card@ split the late poll say we be exactly where we be two year ago . but Nicola Sturgeon be come back for another go . it take a lot of effort to hold off the last independence campaign two year ago and Mrs May should be careful not to give the other side any more ammunition this time round . unless she really want to lose , of course .
Big two in Brexit turf war a Whitehall turf war have break out between Philip Hammond and Liam Fox over Britain ' s post-Brexit trade policy . the Chancellor challenge the International Trade Secretary ' s department to assess whether new free trade deal with non-EU country will compensate for leave the custom union . it be see as a ploy by Mr Hammond , who want a ` ` soft ' ' Brexit , to keep Britain tie to the EU ' S custom union to avoid disrupt business . but it be oppose by Brexit supporter who say it will restrict any chance of an independent international trade policy . as EU rule bar member of the custom union from striking bilateral trade deal , it would make Dr Fox ' s job all-but redundant . he win a Cabinet battle to get a Trade Bill include in the Queen ' s Speech - enable Britain to conduct its own independent policy . the Sun say - Page ten
Un READY BREX ; Survey Delay Row Rudd : @card@ too soon for migrant control HOME Secretary Amber Rudd last night risk a Brexit backlash by signal immigration curb will not be ready by @card@ . she say a committee would spend a year look at immigration from Europe to see how the economy would be hit by a cut in number . the Migration Advisory Committee , which already set limit for non-EU migrant , will not report back until September @card@ . that be just six month before Britain leave the EU . and Ms Rudd say there would be an ` ` implementation period ' ' for any new control after Brexit in March @card@ to prevent spark recruitment crisis for major employer . business group welcome the announcement but hardcore Brexiteers warn against backtrack on repeated promise to cut immigration . there be already an estimated 2.3million EU citizen work in Britain . but the food , hospitality and construction sector be among those warning that tight control would leave them short-staffed . Ms Rudd ' S announcement come after Environment Secretary and Brexit-backer Michael Gove admit free movement be likely to continue during a transitional post-Brexit deal with the EU . the Engineering Employers ' Federation say it be the ` ` first time ' ' the government have acknowledge migration control would be implement ` ` in a measure way over a period of year ' ' . federation of small business chairman Mike Cherry say it would ` ` be welcome by many small business as a sign of much-need stability ' ' . but just @card@ hour earlier , Nigel Farage have accuse Theresa May of a great ` ` Brexit betrayal ' ' . he say : ` ` apart from a few delusional Westminster MP , everyone know that the issue which win Brexit be open-door immigration . ` ` the irony be that the government ' s decision to keep the border open come as the migrant crisis in Italy be intensify . ' ' separately yesterday , Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson insist the government do not want to see a fall in the number of migrant come to work in the tech sector . visit entrepreneur in Sydney , Australia , he say minister want to ensure that ` ` people who have energy and talent and idea can still come to the UK ' ' .
Big demand Nicola Sturgeon be go on holiday to Portugal later this week . but before she jet off to the Algarve , she will leave Scot in no doubt about which direction we ' re heading . in a speech today , she will list the key demand of Scotland ahead of talk about the UK ' s Brexit settlement . Ms Sturgeon ' S wishlist be to be expect . after all , Prime Minister Theresa May have make it clear she want to agree a ` ` UK-wide approach ' ' to Brexit talk with Europe before she launch them . but the PM look to be store up trouble with her pledge . put simply , it ' S hard to see how Ms Sturgeon ' S demand can be satisfy unless the UK stay in the EU . but that horse have bolt , and Brexit mean Brexit , as Tory minister keep tell us . Ms Sturgeon ' s insistence on guarantee over freedom of movement , farming and EU grant be awkward enough for Mrs May . but the First Minister also want us to retain influence over the rule of the single market . and how can you do that unless you ' re an EU member ? it ' s begin to look suspiciously like the SNP supremo have set the bar impossibly high . her first demand be that the democratic wish of Scotland be respect . the only way of do that - after we vote @card@ in favour of Remain - be to stay in the EU . so it look increasingly like we ' re head towards a second independence referendum , with Brexit the justification . but as Ms Sturgeon pack her sun lotion , she might want to think about the comment of her MEP Alyn Smith - a highly respect figure within the party . he warn yesterday that Brexit do not guarantee independence . and he ' S right . the constitutional chaos cause by the EU leave vote last month might be enough to justify a second referendum . but the Nat should be careful not to put their egg in one basket . as Mr Smith say , when it come to the crunch , Europe be just ` ` one issue among many ' ' . and not the silver bullet .
EU ' LL do it May Way ; Theresa BLASTS Brussels PM : we ' ll call the shot over Brexit trade deal Theresa May yesterday slap down snipe EU leader and insist they will do a deal with Brexit Britain - or it will cost them a fortune . in a Thatcher-style blast after a weekend of threat , the PM say that the @card@ member state know it make economic sense to work with the UK . on Friday EU official warn Britain may not even be able to access the single market if it rip up free movement rule . Slovakia ' S PM Robert Fico threaten to veto a Brexit deal and yesterday signal that the EU should punish Britain for leave . but after arrive in New York yesterday , Mrs May say : ` ` look , the @card@ will sign up to a deal with us . ` ` we will be negotiate with them and as I say , we will be ambitious in what we want to see for the UK . ` ` but I think a good deal for the UK can also be a good deal for the other member state . I believe in good trade relation . I want the UK to be a global leader in free trade . ' ' the Prime Minister will back up her boast today by defend the Brexit vote result in her maiden speech to the UN General Assembly . she will say that the vote to leave do not mean that brit want to ` ` walk away from our partner in the world ' ' . once Britain trigger form Article @card@ , formally serve notice that it want to leave the EU , the government will have two year to thrash out a new trade relationship . Mr Fico yesterday claim that Britain be ` ` bluff ' ' in talk up its Brexit prospect . and Hungary have reiterate its plan to veto any deal that curb its people ' s desire to work in the UK . but speak from Dubai , Trade Secretary Liam Fox insist Britain be well-place for economic success . he add that give the amount import from nation such as Germany , France and Italy , it be ` ` very much in the interest of other EU state that Britain and they make a success of Brexit and our new relationship ' ' . Brexit Secretary David Davis last week warn that the negotiation over the separation could prove to be the most complicated ` ` of all time ' ' .
Leo ' S in Control AS May FALTERS TAOISEACH Leo Varadkar have really hit his stride on the Brexit issue in a forceful way that ' S win him deserve plaudit at home . last week he troll the Tory with a Winston Churchill quote . he be at it again this week , tell reporter at the EU summit : ` ` I would hope that some of the people who support Brexit and campaign for it would realise , or at least acknowledge , that they ' re the one who create this problem and I ' m one of the people who be try to resolve it . ' ' this be a sharp rebuke to unionist who refuse to be draw on how the Border will fare after Brexit , say that it ' S the Republic ' S problem and that we should pay for new Border check if they ' re ever require . their stance be as preposterous as their support for the leave campaign . but have take their ill-judged position , they be loathe to change tack . Varadkar must be eternally grateful to the unionist and Tory for make such a hash of the Brexit strategy , as it rescue him from his low ebb after the Tanaiste emails crisis . nothing make a leader look more competent than other ' incompetence . Leo have do well on the Border issue and on Brexit in general . however , he now need to use this currency to solve some of our big problem at home , if it ' S ultimately to be of any benefit to all .

Mrs May refuse four time to say how she would vote in a new poll when quiz by LBC radio host Iain Dale . she say : ` ` You ' re ask me to say how would I vote now against a different background . a different international background , a different economic background . circumstance move on . I think we should all be focus on deliver Brexit . ' ' but her reply horrify Tory Brexiteers . one minister say : ` ` oh my God . that ' S the easy question to answer . I just want to cry . ' ' leave boss and ex-Labour MP Gisela Stuart say : ` ` it would have be more helpful if she say she believe in this . ' ' Pro-EU supporter also blast the Prime Minister . Labour MP Chris Bryant say : ` ` this make her hard Brexit policy all the more irresponsible .

' ' Relations with Arlene Foster ' s Democratic Unionist party in the North have sour over the issue of a post-Brexit border .

the Sun ON Sunday SAYS @card@ @card@ @card@ the gulf in credibility between the Tory and Labour leadership have rarely be great . Theresa May vow today to stick to her timetable to deliver Brexit on behalf of the majority who vote for it . she ' S now off lead a trade mission to secure a vital new deal with India . you may not like her , or Brexit . but that be indisputably what leadership look like . Jeremy Corbyn , by contrast , threaten to force an election if Brexit be not on his term . but earlier , when gently ask if he fancy a snap poll , he bolt like a startle hare - squeal he be be ` ` harass ' ' . Corbyn himself be now a pitiful irrelevance . more troubling be his MP ' plot to negate the referendum verdict . Labour ' S oh-soplausible Brexit spokesman Keir Starmer insist he accept it . other MP say the same . Starmer be still pay by a legal firm that help delay Article @card@ last week . labour plotter and on Wednesday @card@ Labour MP lap up a speech by Tony Blair ' S ex-guru Will Hutton in which he claim , incredibly , the ` ` overwhelming majority of British people ' ' want to reaffirm our EU membership . he urge MP to fight to overturn the June @card@ result . the delusion and arrogance of this ruling elite be off the scale . yet these be the true motive of some Labour MP and of Lib-Dems include Nick Clegg and many of his party ' S peer . their dangerous attempt to negate Britain ' s big ever democratic vote will go on until Article @card@ be trigger . if the Supreme Court rule against her , the PM must force a bill through without delay . PM must crush the Labour plotter
BREX Symbol ; @card@ MSPs Vote ' No ' To Euro Split Nat hail fight to ' make Scot hear ' on EU HOLYROOD yesterday vote to oppose the UK trigger Brexit in a desperate bid to send a message to Theresa May . the non-binding motion be carry by @card@ vote to @card@ with only the Tories and Labour rebel Neil Findlay , Richard Leonard and Elaine Smith reject it . but the Nat - who grant MSPs a say despite Supreme Court judge rule last month that Holyrood ca n't block Brexit - insist it be more than just a cheap stunt after Scotland ' s Remain vote in last year ' S referendum . the party ' S Brexit Minister Michael Russell say : ` ` this vote be more than symbolic . ` ` it be a key test of whether Scotland ' S voice be be listen to . ` ` this debate give MSPs the opportunity to speak loudly and clearly , to reaffirm the vote that be so conclusive last year and to say to the UK , to Europe and to the world that we oppose the catastrophic hard Brexit now be pursue . ` ` but time be run out . vote to reject the trigger of Article @card@ be now the only way to remind the Prime Minister of her promise , and of the disastrous consequence of the path she seem set on . ' ' the motion say that ` ` the decision to proceed do not respect the majority vote to remain part of the EU that be return in every council area in Scotland ' ' . Labour ' S Lewis Macdonald claim leave the EU would be ` ` a sombre day ' ' . and he blast the PM for turn the process into a ` ` disaster ' ' . he say : ` ` Theresa May would rather hold hand with Donald Trump than work hand in glove with Angela Merkel . ' ' Ross Greer of the green say the northsouth Brexit split leave voter with a choice . he say : ` ` the time for compromise have almost pass . it be time for all of us to choose between a Brexit Britain , tilt towards Trump , or an independent Scotland in Europe . ' ' but Tory John Lamont slam the SNP ' S tactic . he say : ` ` they have be on the lose side of two recent referendum , and seem unable to accept the result of either . ' ' Theresa May see off a revolt by top pro-EU Tories last night in a major challenge to her authority . the PM face a demand that she get MP ' approval before walk away from a bad Brexit deal . but the government win the knife-edge vote @card@ to @card@ .
it ' S YOUR Right To CHOOSE Future Monday ' S announcement certainly seem to have catch the Tory government flat-footed - but that just show how badly out of touch they be with the mood in Scotland . last summer I welcome Theresa May ' s assurance that she would seek agreement with the devolve administration on a UK-wide approach before trigger Article @card@ . but nine month on from the Brexit vote , the language of partnership be go . it have become clear that the Tories be intent on pursue a hard Brexit no matter what the consequence be for job , the economy and livelihood . and no matter what the people of Scotland think . the people of England and Wales vote leave , and I fully respect that . but nothing we be propose will prevent them from leave the EU . people in Scotland vote by a 24-point margin to Remain - and our voice count too . at time like these , it ' s more important than ever to have a clear plan for the way ahead - to try , as far as be possible , to be in control of event and not just at the mercy of them . we believe that you , the people of Scotland , should have a choice about our future . with the approval of the Scottish Parliament , we will open discussion with Westminster about hold a referendum - give you a choice between the hard Brexit or to become an independent country . for the Tories to try to block this referendum would be completely and utterly untenable and indefensible - and privately they know this . at last year ' S election , the SNP win the high constituency vote share of any party in the history of the Scottish Parliament . our manifesto state : ` ` the Scottish Parliament should have the right to hold another referendum ... if there be a significant and material change in the circumstance that prevail in @card@ , such as Scotland be take out the EU against our will . ' ' well , that be exactly the situation we ' re now in . and with the support of the green , there be a parliamentary mandate to hold a referendum . it would also be untenable for the Tories to try and rig the timing of the referendum . if the Tories ' argument be that another referendum add to the uncertainty cause by Brexit , then delay it beyond Brexit would only add to the uncertainty . the UK Government concede that the last referendum must be ` ` make in Scotland ' ' , and they must honour that principle again this time - there should be no string attach , no block mechanism apply and no Downing Street diktat . some people have say Brexit uncertainty mean that voter will be ' voting blind ' - that they wo n't have the right information to make an informed choice . but here ' s the key point : we be not propose that the referendum be hold until autumn @card@ at the early . it be between then and spring @card@ that the shape of the UK ' s Brexit deal will have become clear . so by that stage there will be clarity about what the term of Brexit will look like - but also clarity about independence . that be therefore the right time to choose the future of Scotland . and we trust you , the people of Scotland , to make that choice . 6It ' s clear Tory be intent on hard Brexit7

legal battle over Brexit Scotland Secretary David Mundell be refreshingly honest in his assessment of the Brexit process yesterday - and remarkably consistent in his view of relation with Holyrood . the SNP Government have be furious all week because the UK Supreme Court refuse to back their claim that Holyrood should be allow to vote on Article @card@ before the Brexit process can begin . Holyrood minister say Brexit will change the responsibility of the Scottish Parliament and that ca n't happen without a Legislative Consent Motion . but judge say , quite rightly , that it be not a decision for them and the working of the LCM process be not a matter for the law to decide . yesterday Mr Mundell stick by his position . the EU be not a devolve issue , so Brexit do n't need an LCM . but he be equally firm when he say that change the law in Scotland be a devolve issue and it do need an LCM . Holyrood be hold the whip hand that means abolish EU law and write it into the statute book for Scotland ca n't go ahead without approval from Holyrood . this be a huge opportunity for the Scottish government . when power come back to the UK from Brussels - power over key area like environmental protection , consumer right , fishery and agriculture - they will affect a range of devolve area . now the fight be on to see whether all those power in devolve area come straight to Edinburgh , or whether Westminster cherry pick the good of them . Holyrood be hold the whip hand . MSPs can throw an enormous spanner in the Brexit work if they do n't get a deal that suit them . without a Legislative Consent Motion , there be a risk that all the EU law that now govern our life could be abolish with nothing to replace them - and nobody want to see that happen . on the other hand , it will be a grim moment for ardent Brexiteers when they finally realise that every single one of the EU law they hate so much will still be in place the day after we leave the EU .

peace offer WITH the Brexit deadline get closer , peace seem to be break out between Holyrood and Westminster .

a borderline issue ? Brexit may well hurt peace in this land This week the British Prime Minister Theresa May finally confirm when she will formally trigger the Article @card@ process of leave the European Union . the UK will begin by write to the President of the European Council Donald Tusk on March @card@ . despite clarity emerge on the date , the confusion and disunity which have become the hallmark of the UK government since last June be once again on show over the past few day . as I mention in this column last week , Nicola Sturgeon manage to upset the apple cart by announce her intention to hold another referendum on Scottish independence . this be the beginning of a collision course between May ' s inner circle in government and the devolve government - who feel increasingly ignore by the power that be in London . the response of the PM to the Scottish demand be to dismiss the prospect of the referendum before the conclusion of the Brexit negotiation . not surprisingly , Sturgeon respond by suggest the PM ' s willingness to refuse a referendum be ' undemocratic ' and proof that the Tories fear the verdict of the Scottish people . this be just the beginning of their problem with the devolve government . one of the first mistake after notify Tusk of her intention to trigger Article @card@ on March @card@ be to ignore the UK ' s joint ministerial council and go straight to the press . in fact , the first many senior politician hear of the decision be via the various media outlet . the Scottish parliament ' s minister on the Brexit Joint Ministerial Council , Michael Russell , tweet : ` ` thank you @ BBCNews for let JMC member like me know that # Article50 be to be trigger next week . @ GOVUK somehow forget to inform us . ' ' this be perhaps not the smart way to kick off proceeding , immediately alienate important stakeholder in the UK ' S future . it seem it ' s not just the Scot who be angry with May ' s approach to Brexit and the future of the UK . despite voting in favour of leave the EU along with England , the Welsh be now feel alienate from the process and this week add their voice to the warning come from Scotland and the North . the Welsh First Minister Carwyn Jones accuse May of have a ' tin ear ' when it come to issue concern the Welsh assembly . he seem to be look for some sort of reward for Wales in recognition of voting in favour of Brexit , but he warn that people ' S sense of disillusionment , currently direct at Brussels , may soon target London . he say : ` ` if they ' re not careful , people ' S sense of disengagement with Brussels will simply attach itself to London . ` ` we need to see there be a dividend in be a devolutionist government that support the union and we do n't see that dividend . ' ' the absence of an Executive in the North have , perhaps for now , cause the response lf b ted how from Belfast to be more muted . however , there be plenty of political activist more than willing to jump on the Brexit turmoil in London in order to pursue the nationalist agenda of a unite Ireland . as in Scotland , a majority of voter in the North dissent from the decision to leave the EU . while May be about to embark on a tour of the four nation of the United Kingdom , and have refer to the UK as the ` ` precious union of nation ... the most successful the world have ever know ' ' , there be undoubtedly many across the North who disagree . Brexit have give those with dream of a unite Ireland a fresh impetus . they see an opportunity now to refocus on pursue a different path . a flashpoint issue in the North , in the context of Brexit , will be the issue of the Border . this be a tangible and imminent change face the North , which do not appear on the horizon for Scotland or Wales . it could become a dangerous trigger point in two year ' time if the issue be not deal with by Brexit negotiation . both government in Dublin and London say they be commit to maintain an ' invisible border ' with no obvious change to it from April @card@ , once the UK leave the EU . our own government have be lobby for agreement at EU level that the border issue can be resolve directly between the UK and Ireland . I ' m not convince this can or will happen . all of the claim about maintain the status quo in relation to the Border seem to ignore the fact that the UK will leave the EU , include the Single Market and the Customs Union . assume the UK insist on this form of ' hard Brexit ' , then it be unavoidable that new custom control will have to be introduce between the UK and the rest of the EU , include the Republic of Ireland . there may also be the introduction of tariff on good be sell into and out of the UK . if this be the case , an invisible border be impossible . the impact of such a development on political stability in the North can not be underestimate . there be a risk that the re-introduction of a border between the North and South will lead to a rapid escalation of call for a unite Ireland . it be impossible to predict whether this could irreparably damage the peace process in the North , but it be certainly likely to have an impact .

fib on show when Michael Gove be lead the Brexit campaign he say that there would be a bumper bundle of power come to Holyrood after Brexit - and he include immigration in that . the First Minister dismiss that as ` ` a fib and a half ' ' . last week Scotland Secretary David Mundell rule out any chance of immigration power come to Holyrood after Brexit . immigration , he say , be not devolve . Mr Mundell could not even give any guarantee about thing that be devolve - area such as fishing and agriculture . the EU responsibility on those area might not be automatically devolve to Holyrood , he say . and that mean all or part of those power - such as control over fishing quota in the North Sea - might be retain at Westminster . despite that , Nicola Sturgeon will come forward tomorrow with a wish list of demand for a post-Brexit Scotland . and at the top of that list will be immigration power , along with a lot of other stuff which the First Minister say be all a fib just six month ago . the First Minister and her Brexit adviser have work long and hard on this stuff . they have work out the building block that must be put in place if Scotland be go to get something close to what Scotland vote for - a place in the UK and a place in the EU . the chance of that happen be about as slim as the UK Government ' s ` ` have our cake and eat it ' ' plan . as far as be part of the UK be concern , in mean in and out be out . same for Europe - as Theresa May be already discover . it ' S beyond unlikely that the UK Government will adopt the Scottish plan as its official Brexit negotiate position and go to Brussel ask to take England out of Europe but plead for Scotland to stay half-in . but the First Minister will demand that her plan be debate in public and , if it be dismiss by Westminster , it will have to be dismiss in public . Ms Sturgeon do n't expect to succeed . she want the ` ` fib and a half ' ' on show for all the world to see .

Blair ' S BREXIT Exocet ; Bid to derail talk Tony Blair will attempt to derail Britain ' s Brexit negotiation next week by meet EU chief Jean-Claude Juncker . the Europe fanatic will have talk in Brussels at the same time as Brexit Secretary David Davis and opposite negotiator Michel Barnier be expect to hold a press conference . Brussels official insist the pair be meet because they be ` ` good friend ' ' - despite clash several time in @card@ when Mr Juncker be Luxembourg PM and Mr Blair be in No10 . a European Commission spokesman add : ` ` the president ' S door be always open and he look for a timing which work for both of www.them.No conspiracy there , I ' m afraid . ' ' but the timing of their first know meeting since the Brexit process begin raise eyebrow in Westminster . negotiation will hit a crucial stage next week when Mr Davis and Mr Barnier have a third round of crucial talk . aide say Mr Blair and Mr Juncker would discuss European politics and the Middle East but ` ` refuse to give any further detail .

Sun THE SAYS Brexit buckler Labour ' S Keir Starmer would ` ` negotiate ' ' Brexit by surrender to every EU demand . he ' s fine with EU citizen have more right here than brit , for example . why ? because he want European court to have power over ours after Brexit . the Shadow Brexit Secretary be at the epicentre of Labour ' s hopeless confusion over the big issue Britain face . he want some sort of single market membership , while insist free movement must end - a fudge already reject outright by the EU . he be at odd with Jeremy Corbyn and his colleague , all hope voter do n't notice their contradictory position . Starmer be a diehard Remainer feign interest in Brexit . his heart be n't in it .
May ' S resolution must be resolute THERE be three new year resolution that Theresa May need to make . she must be decisive on Brexit , Bold on housing and , to top it all off , Fix social care . if Mrs May can do these three thing , @card@ will be a far good year for her than @card@ be . but none of this will be easy , and it will all be make harder by the mistake she make last year . on Brexit , Mrs May have yet to say what she think the UK ' s final deal with the EU should be . this be a problem for several reason . if you be not certain about what you be aim for , it be very hard to succeed in a negotiation . secondly , until the PM have decide what she want , it be very difficult for the government to make the positive case for Brexit - to explain what the UK will be able to do differently once we have leave the European Union . electoral poison in the run-up to Christmas , the inner Cabinet and the Cabinet both properly debate the Brexit ` ` end-state ' ' for the first time . cabinet source tell me that these discussion have not move forward over the holiday . but time be of the essence . the sooner the Cabinet agree a position , the sooner the government can start prepare its negotiate strategy for the next round of the Brexit talk . what Mrs May must remember be that there be little point in leave the EU if Britain do not have the ability to do thing differently afterwards . Mrs May have start the year by reiterate her desire to be the Prime Minister who fix the housing crisis . but if she be to do this , then she be go to have to be a lot bold than she have be to date . she will have to confront an uncompetitive construction sector and a planning system that do n't allow enough house to be build where people want to live . in the run-up to the most recent Budget , Mrs May even veto a plan that would have let house be build on green belt within half a mile of station in area of high demand . she will have to shed this caution if the decline in home ownership , which be so lethal to the Tories ' electoral prospect , be to be reverse . this week , Mrs May have be apologise to NHS patient who have have their operation cancel . but prevent this from become an annual occurrence will require sort social care . the Tory be understandably nervous about this issue . it be , after all , their botched social care reform plan that make their manifesto such electoral poison and set in train the sequence of event that end with Mrs May lose her majority . there be , though , a solution to this problem that be politically doable . it would involve the government cap social care cost and require the over-40s to buy insurance . if Mrs May can get these three thing do in @card@ , she will have go a long way to undo the damage do by the disaster of last year ' S General Election campaign . but if the Tories ca n't make progress on these front in the next @card@ month , then Jeremy Corbyn will be that much close to Downing Street . lJames Forsyth be political editor of the Spectator .
wall TO pay for ; Hoey want to make Republic fund border BREXIT News @card@ MP Kate Hoey be compare to Donald Trump after demand the Republic cough up for any hard border . the pro-Brexit Labour member , originally from Mallusk , Co Antrim , say the UK will not be erect-ing any infrastructure when it quit the European Union . she say : ` ` we ' re not the one who be go to be put up the physical border . ' ' and she add if no agreement be strike with London and Brussels on trade rule , the Irish ` ` will have to pay for it , because it do n't need to happen ' ' . historian Mary Beard draw comparison with the US president ' s demand that his nation ' s southern neighbour should fork out for a border wall . she say unionist Ms Hoey ` ` sound to me dangerously like Mr Trump and Mexico ' ' . and former Secretary of State for Northern Ireland Peter Hain , also of the Labour Party , say : ` ` Kate Hoey seem to have be take diplomacy lesson from Donald Trump . ` ` it really be astonishing how much damage Brexit be already do to our country ' S reputation . even our close friend , Ireland , be now the target of unhinge attack from hard Brexit cheerleader . ' ' the row over how to maintain a ` ` soft ' ' border be a key sticking point in the Brexit talk .
Brexit reality as Holyrood Ministers travel to London today for the late in a series of Brexit talk , the time have come for a reality check . in spite of everything that Theresa May say this week , SNP politician be cling blindly to the notion that there may yet be some kind of separate deal for Scotland . Nicola Sturgeon ' s plan for Scotland to keep one foot inside the single market be far-fetched at good but it can not survive the shock of Mrs May ' s Brexit statement . the Prime Minister have make it clear there will be no special treatment for Scotland , the Chancellor have say as much and the message be hammer home yesterday by Scotland Secretary David Mundell . he say : ` ` I have not see evidence which would persuade me that there be a need for a Scotland-specific solution in relation either to market access or in relation to issue around migration . ' ' and , at the same time , Mr Mundell assure the Scottish Government : ` ` we be look at their proposal carefully ' ' - in the same way a parent say ` ` that ' s the good paint I ' ve ever see , ' ' when a five-year-old bring his late picture home from school . yet SNP minister remain wed to the idea that somebody might be listen to them . surely today ' s Brexit meeting in London must mark the end of that notion . surely , when that meeting finish , grown-up in both government be go to have to admit the obvious truth - that England vote for Brexit and Scotland be just go to have to suck it up . we need some responsibility from our politician now . we do n't need sneer and namecalling and Little Britain insult fling across the House of Commons . we need clarity and truthfulness and fact because that ' s the only way we will be able to plot a course forward through this mess . it ' s time to wake up and smell the Brexit .
the future be n't orange ... it ' S green ; May ' S N.I . deal PUTS Ireland in Charge of BREXIT Policy when the DUP be negotiate its Â£1billion pay off from Theresa May in exchange for keep her in power , party leader Arlene Foster say : ` ` the future ' s bright . ' ' memorably , her DUP colleague Ian Paisley Jr add : ` ` the future ' S orange . ' ' but yesterday , Foster help to engineer a Brexit that be decidedly green . the Brexit deal announce yesterday - bring about only because the DUP scupper the last one - have put Ireland , and not the UK , in charge of the nation ' s Brexit policy . a year and a half after the Brexit vote , the UK side manage to come up with a deal which actually recognise the existence of a land border with an independent EU neighbour . and the deal agree to keep Ireland sweet commit the entire UK to be inside the Single Market and the Customs Union for the foreseeable future while also insist that we ' re not . the key passage in Theresa May ' s statement yesterday be this : ` ` the United Kingdom will maintain full alignment with those rule of the internal market and the custom union which , now or in the future , support North-South co-operation , the all-island economy and the protection of the @card@ agreement . ' ' it ' S the ` ` in the future ' ' bit which count . it mean that every change in EU rule which take place in the Irish Republic must be slavishly copy in Northern Ireland . and , since the deal do not single Northern Ireland out , but apply across the whole UK , those rule will be copy across the whole UK ` ` in the future ' ' . but there ' S more . Mrs May ' S statement not only promise no barrier to trade in Ireland ` ` north-south ' ' she also say that would apply ` ` east-west ' ' . Britain ' s trade with Ireland and Ireland ' s trade with Britain will have to be carry on inside the same arrangement we currently use for the Single Market and the Customs Union ` ` in the future . ' ' Earlier this week the DUP refuse to allow any kind of differentiate Brexit policy for Northern Ireland . they insist it have to leave Europe on exactly the same term as the rest of the UK and our own Ruth Davidson back them to the hilt . it have n't happen . instead , what we ' ve got be the UK leave Europe on the same term as Northern Ireland . as well as have Brexit policy decide by ten MP from a party believe in dinosaur , a party nobody on this side of the water can even vote for , now have our trade policy fit to the single market whatever Dublin do . that ' S Brexit . that ' s ` ` take back control ' ' . that do n't norty de an we de he by lin xit . cka e. on d-a for Scotland it ' s surprising outcome . Nicola Sturgeon have be demand Scotland get a special deal to keep the country inside ep de the Customs Union and the Single Market only to be tell that it be out of the question . now the whole of the UK be leave both while , at the same time , ` ` maintain full alignment with the rule of the internal market and the custom union . ' ' ` ` it seem as if the SNP have get what it want but , naturally , they be not content . Thehe First Minister say the deal have shoot down for good any notion of border post at Gretna Green if Scottish independence ever happen . and , without actually address whether that ' s true or not , Ruth Davidson take a pop at the FM for raise independence yet again . the FM be two step ahead of herself . the border question really only arise if Scotland for independence another referendum and then gain admission to the EU . land vote udL Ro Let ' s cross those bridge when we come to them . in du adbr cothe im to sh sea ca an po the wh ru ha pr I e mha anoeh uar in the meantime there be more important question consider - like shoe and ship and seal wax and cabbage and king and how we can possibly be outside Single Market while adhere to its rule and pay handsomely for the privilege .
Boris ' S BREXIT Red Line ; WARNINGS To PM ON TRANSITION Deal Boris Johnson have lay out his four red line for Brexit , insist the transition period must last ` ` not a second more ' ' than two year . all his demand go further than the agree Cabinet position , hammer out after a summer of infighting . the Foreign Secretary also use a pre-Tory conference interview with the Sun to reflect leave voter ' anger over the transition period during which the UK will still be govern by all the EU ' S rule . but his fresh Brexit intervention will anger Theresa May and risk reopen the feud among her senior minister . the PM use her speech in Florence last week to call for a changeover period from March @card@ to break the Brexit talk ' deadlock and win busi-nesses time to adapt . there be no Cabinet agreement on how long it should last , with Mrs May suggest ` ` exclusive by ` ` around two year ' ' . but Boris last night say anything longer than @card@ month - effectively to March @card@ , @card@ - would be a mistake that would leave Brexit voter feel betray . talk to the Sun in his vast room in the Foreign Office , overlook St James ' s Park , the 53-year-old Tory big beast say : ` ` I get that from my own talk to people . very strongly . ` ` what that teach me be that really be it . Rien ne va plus . Finito la Musica . then we come out . there can be no monkey around . ` ` be I impatient about it , do I want to get it do as fast as possible ? yes , absolutely . do I want the delay to go on long than two year ? not a second more . ' ' Boris list three other condition that he want the PM to agree to for the transition period : l Britain must refuse to accept any new EU rule or euro judge ' ruling make during the transition period . quiz on whether a status quo transition mean agree to new Brussels diktat , BoJo argue : ` ` you hear the Prime Minister say very clearly in Florence that she envisage the transition period be run under existing arrangement - that be the phrase she use , ' the exist rule ' . ' ' there must be no further payment to Brussels at all for single market access when the transition period end . Boris explain : ` ` what I have always say be that we will pay for thing that be reasonable , scientific programme . ` ` but when it come to pay for access to the market , that wo n't happen any more than we would expect them to pay us for access to our market . ' ' the final post-transition deal must also not see the UK shadow Brussels rule to ensure easy access to the single market . BoJo insist : ` ` there be no point in come out of the EU and then remain in rotational orbit around it . that be the bad of both world . you have to be able to have control of your regulatory framework . ' ' he concede that a transition be also necessary for the government , as some department may not be ready to deal with Brexit on March @card@ , @card@ , the day the UK formally leave the EU . he admit : ` ` I be afraid the truth be that there be government department that , at the current rate of fire , be go to need to get ready . ' ' but by lay down fresh demand , Boris will again be see as establish himself as the defender of the true Brexit faith . it emerge yesterday that he be the top choice among Conservative member to succeed Theresa May . a YouGov poll of activist show he be back in favour after be see to challenge Mrs May ' S authority , with his 4,300-word article lay out his Brexit vision . May in Florence but BoJo insist it be not a pitch for party leadership , say speculation about his intention have be ` ` massively ' ' overdo . instead , he issue a slapdown to Brexit doubter , say : ` ` the crucial thing I want to get over to Sun reader about Brexit be that it be go to be great and we need to believe in ourselves and believe we can do it . it be unstoppable . ai n't no stop us now . ` ` there be a disjuncture between the debate in Westminster and the London bubble and where a lot of people be in the country . ` ` most people ca n't understand what this conversation be all about . we leave . we vote for that last year - so let ' s get on with it .

' ' refer to the chance of another vote , she add : ` ` that case perhaps will become quite difficult to resist . ' ' Tory deputy leader Jackson Carlaw accuse Ms Sturgeon , below , of hope Brexit would be a ` ` disaster ' ' in order to strengthen her case for another indy vote . he say : ` ` with her penchant for re-running democratic referendum , it ' s no surprise to hear her hint at another vote . ` ` but the people of Scotland be sick of these game , and want a government who will make a success of Brexit , not use it to stoke grievance . ' ' at their conference in Glasgow yesterday , SNP member unanimously back a motion call on Westminster to ` ` give up its democratically indefensible Brexit power grab ' ' on the Scottish Parliament with its EU Withdrawal Bill . the Nat administration have say it wo n't recommend Holyrood give the green light to the legislation as it now stand and Ms Sturgeon , along with Welsh First Minister Carwyn Jones , have outline @card@ change she want make . the resolution also call for the Scottish government to be invite to the negotiate table as Britain prepare to leave the EU in March @card@ .
Brex-ing heart the government may have be irate at the UK announce it will ban Irish trawler from its water yesterday but they have well get use to it . whether we in this country like it or not , Brexit seem to be go full steam ahead - and there will be a lot more news just like yesterday ' s come down the line . the fishing ban be far from the big problem we will deal with as most of our trawler operate out of Atlantic port in any case . however , the announcement underline the folly of the belief that we will somehow get a good deal out of Brexit than other European state because of our historical relationship with Britain . the EU have already be quite clear on this - all decision on these matter will be take at Brussels rather than Dublin level . a critical look at both the Irish and British government claim that there will be no hard border simply do not stand up either . expert who have work in European custom law for decade say this be simply not possible , that some custom check will be require . as it stand , Britain be Ireland ' s big trading partner . with substantial disagreement over the Brexit bill the UK will have to pay and the potential for a hard Brexit loom , we need to address that . we have two year to avoid Brexit have a significant economic impact here and a lot of work to do to avoid it .
Brex factor TWO year ago when the SNP come forward with their proposal for independence they produce a 350-page document set out every detail of their plan . you could agree with it , or disagree with it , you could embrace it as the Gospel truth or dismiss it as dewy-eyed fantasy . but , when we cast our vote , we largely know what be at stake and what be on offer . two month after the Brexit vote it should be a cause of burn shame to the UK Government that they be unable to answer the simple question about what Brexit be . they do no homework before the big vote and they seem to have do almost nothing since . yesterday , when the pointless Jeremy Corbyn be dribble on in a series of ramble question about housing , it be Angus Robertson of the SNP who hold the Prime Minister to account . in his new role as Leader of the opposition in wait , Mr Robertson want to know if Britain will be in or out of the single market . after a long summer tackle the Brexit question , the Prime Minister could not tell him . that ' S hardly surprising since her Brexit Secretary David Davis have already rule that being part of the single market be ` ` highly improbable ' ' - only for No10 to then slap him aside . in the Scottish Parliament , there be critic on every side who attack the First Minister for press the start button on another independence referendum . they say , quite rightly , that she believe independence be the answer to Scotland ' S ill , no matter what . but be they also say that , no matter what Brexit settlement Westminster eventually get round to think up , Scotland must simply swallow it ? that ' S for the people to decide and Nicola Sturgeon may at least give us the choice .

if Lords hold up Brexit . . they ' ll be next fur the chop expect the House of Lords to be happy about Brexit be like expect turkey to be all excite about Christmas . the British people may have vote to leave the EU in great number than we ever vote for anything , but the House of Lords be almost comically unrepresentative of our nation . in the real world , all the Lib Dem MP can travel together in the same minicab while in the House of Lords the Lib Dems be a political force once more , with @card@ peer . in the real world , Labour be a die party but in the alternative universe of the House of Lords , Labour be still a mighty powerhouse with @card@ peer , include some mouth-foaming , eye-swivelling Euroloons like Baron Mandelson , right , and Baron Kinnock . the House of Lords be as instinctively anti-Brexit as the BBC . but there be one crucial difference between the upper chamber and Broadcasting House . many lordship be on EU pension . as my colleague David Wooding exclusively reveal today dozen of lucky Lords be in line for whopping EU annuity . and the term and condition of European Commission pension effectively demand that they support the EU . so how can their lordship possibly be fair and rational when debate this country ' s exit from the EU ? if they dare choose Britain over Brussels then the overdress old relic risk put their pension pot in www.peril.No wonder they be get their ermine robe in a twist about Brexit . it stink to high heaven that anyone in Parliament should have a personal financial incentive to put the interest of their EU paymaster over Britain . dozen of peer have exactly that incentive , although you would never know it because they have decide it would be ` ` distasteful ' ' to declare their EU pension in any debate . why ? if some of their lordship be set to be the red-robed bitch of Brussels , they should at least have the courage , honesty and common decency to admit it . it be a national scandal that EU pensioner in the House of Lords do not have to declare their personal stake in this country stay inside the EU . we make a fuss when some dozy MP be catch fiddle his expense but it be a far great outrage that some member of the Lords be debate our future without own up to what ' S in it for them . tomorrow the House of Lords will continue the debate on Article @card@ , the bill that will formally trigger the start of Brexit and allow Theresa May to begin formal divorce proceeding with the EU . the elect member of the House of Commons have indicate - by a majority of @card@ - that they intend to respect the democratic will of the British people who , lest we forget , be endlessly tell that their decision in the referendum be final . will the House of Lords show the same respect for democracy ? finger cross , eh ? for us and for them . because if some preen , unelected nob decide that they wish to delay , hamstring or even deny Brexit then they will be sign the death warrant of the House of Lords . ` ` Our role be to review and amend legislation , not to kill it , ' ' Paul Strasburger , a Liberal Democrat peer , tell the Financial Times . ` ` there be definitely an appetite for improve this bill . ' ' do n't bite off more than you can chew , your lordship . nothing can stop Brexit now . but that do not mean that the House of Lords will not try . many of us have long suspect that the great resistance to Brexit would come from the pound-store Caesar in the House of Lords . their delay tactic will include demand for great parliamentary scrutiny over Brexit negotiation - horribly ironic , as endless EU legislation have be wave through Parliament without proper scrutiny for more than @card@ year . the good news be that the come day will shine an unforgive light on the House of Lords and some haughty , unelected halfwit . it will oblige us all to take a long , hard look at Parliament ' s unelected upper chamber , which dwarf the elect House of Commons with @card@ sit Lords , include nearly @card@ hereditary peer - almost all man because most hereditary peerage can only be inherit by man . what century be these puffed-up old fossil live in ? and while I understand how many of their Lordships benefit from British membership of the EU , how exactly do British democracy benefit from these selfimportant old booby ? you ca n't help notice that the House of Lords be the absolute spit image of the European Union - with some jumped-up , gravy train-hogging nobody who you never vote for and who you can never kick out . would n't it be a gloriously fine day for British democracy if we leave one and then abolish the other ?

yes we should have another referendum ... to ditch Lords ANYONE up for another referendum ? the last one be quite good fun . and this might be even good . abolish the House of Lords . just an easy yes or no will do . this week their unelected lordship shuffle and drool their way into the chamber , pick up their Â£300 daily attendance dosh on their way . a decrepit retinue of timeserver , party donor , smirk , flatulent businessman , backwoods inbred aristos , the has-been and the never has-been . and they vote , by a large margin , to actually derail Brexit . to stop the will of the people . to effectively ignore a decision make by the citizen of this country and which have a clear and decisive outcome . also , a vote agree upon by the democratically elect House of Commons . and which have since be ratify by the House of Commons . the Lords demand that Brexit can go ahead only if the House of Commons have what it call a ` ` meaningful ' ' debate about the issue . this be perhaps the most meaningless and disingenuous decision ever make by either House . we have plenty of meaningful , and meaningless , debate about Brexit during the run-up to the referendum last June . what the Lords be determine to do be stymie Brexit at every step of the way . to stop it from happen . to put as many obstacle in the way as possible . they be quite clear about this . just listen to that arrogant ( and fail ) old Tory toff Lord Heseltine on the subject . or the sanctimonious whine of Lord Pantsdown , sorry Ashdown . they want it stop . incredible , be n't it , that Remoaners will use every unelected institution in the land to overthrow a democratic decision ? first we have the filthy-rich city fund manager Gina Miller decide she do n't like the result of the referendum . she ' S not elect , of course . she take her complaint to the judge , who be also unelected . they agree with her , as you might expect . delay number one and a huge cost to the taxpayer . and now the Remoaners be pin their hope on another unelected body to thwart the will of the people , through their eminent lordship . delay number two , three , four , five ... next time someone who vote Remain start lecture you about democracy , break their glass and spit on their moccasin . theirs have become a campaign utterly devoid of principle . they do not even pretend any more that they care about what way the public vote . this be the rich , the powerful , the unelected - in short the British establishment - tell the ordinary people that they ' re too stupid to make a decision . and when they do make a decision it should be ignore . still , one good thing will come of this . in defy the will of the people the lord and lady be hasten the day of their oblivion . because there will be a grow clamour to either reform the House of Lords - slim it down , get rid of the dead and rot wood , make it more accountable - or get rid of it altogether . that day ca n't come quickly enough for me . yesterday be International Women ' S day . I spend quite a bit of it walk through the street of my local town and cheer and clap at any woman I see . I ' m sure they appreciate this gesture and I think it be a bit high-handed of the police to tell me to , ` ` go home and stop be so bloody stupid ' ' . later I watch a rerun of University Challenge , which the feminist have be complain about . all eight contestant be white man . where ' s the diversity , the femmoes moan ? well , I assume the eight people pick be the bright the university have to offer .

Labour ' S Stephen Kinnock say : ` ` not sign a transitional agreement would mean punish tariff which would hit British business and raise price in shop . ' '
the Sun SAYS Brexit blind the government may be in disarray - but David Davis ' s handling of Brexit be not . many people claim the Tory be bungle the negotiation . that ' S certainly the message relentlessly pump out by the Remainers dominating TV , social medium and some paper . they ' re wrong . Brexit must mean leave the single market and custom union . even sensible Remainers accept that ` ` leave ' ' have no meaning if we stay in either one . the Tories follow that simple logic . they spell out our position , offer a firm commitment on EU citizen here and give considerable ground . they sensibly ask for a two-year transition follow by a free trade deal . Davis ca n't offer vast sum as a ` ` divorce bill ' ' without know what we get for it . the obstinate EU wo n't say . so we wait . how else could he have play it ? Labour can not answer that without spout meaningless nonsense . EU chief Jean-Claude Juncker think it ' S as easy as Britain pay our bar bill - except the EU expect us to settle everyone ' S drink tab . doubtless Juncker be use to other buy his brandy . but after @card@ year put in far more than we get out , it be n't our round .

I know , I ' ve speak to a hell of a lot of them . the mood about leave the EU have not change one iota . Labour , to its enormous credit , support the Brexit decision and do so throughout the campaign .

' ' you will have the support of the leave wing of the Labour Party , which hate the EU just as much as the Ukip lot hate the EU . if Philip Hammond start whine about ` ` soft Brexit ' ' , sack the idiot . he ' S not much use anyway . and face the likes of Tusk and Juncker with a bit of spine and resolve , know that a proper Brexit be what we vote for one year ago . do that and - who know ? - it might even improve your standing with the public . which be currently rock bottom .

Westminster want to do all the decide , but it turn out they ca n't even decide the time .
FLEXI MIGRANTS ; UK ' could vary EU worker level after Brexit ' BREXIT @card@ Britain could have different limit on immigration for each sector of the economy after Brexit , it emerge yesterday . immigration minister Robert Goodwill suggest a flexible system could plug shortage in certain industry . he say the government want to avoid a post-Brexit ` ` cliff-edge ' ' drop in number as it will take time to train UK citizen . it could mean industry currently rely on EU worker such as healthcare , construction , hospitality and agriculture continue to employ high number of migrant from the continent . that would mirror a current scheme for non-EU worker , where visa be allocate depend on the need of different sector . Mr Goodwill , grill by a parliamentary committee yesterday , refuse to say if Britain will opt for a visa-based , points-based or another immigration system for EU citizen after we leave . end open-door immigration be Theresa May ' s top priority for Brexit talk but Mr Goodwill warn the government ' s pledge to cut number to the ten of thousand be ` ` not go to be do in the next two or three year ' ' . earlier this year Mr Goodwill propose charge firm Â£1,000 for every EU worker they bring in after Brexit to help slash number - but he be humiliate when No10 dump the idea hour later . the Sun say - Page ten

IMPROPERGANDA ; a TRAGIC Death TWISTED Into an EU Scare Campaign Mr Jozwik die after a drunken street scuffle . it be NOT murder . it be NOT racism . yet shameful Remain politician peddle it as a Brexit-fuelled slaying . this Polish man be use for ... THEY call it a Brexit murder . a political killing . an act of Leave-fuelled xenophobic hatred . the death of a Polish man after a brawl in Essex in August @card@ be proof , they say , that Briton vote to leave the EU have unleash dark prejudice . and now , they warn , these prejudice be turn violent . politician , EU bureaucrat and campaigner rush to pontificate about the death of 40-year-old Arek Jozwik in Harlow - a town where @card@ per cent of voter have choose leave in the referendum . they hold it up as bloody evidence that Brexit be build on anti-migrant fury . and bad be to come . this be just a snapshot of the horror that would define Brexit Britain . one year on , we now know they be lie . there be no evidence for their claim that this be a ` ` Brexit murder ' ' . it be just a tragic encounter on a boozy Saturday night out . the political elite ' s milk of Mr Jozwik ' S death be one of the most shameless misinformation campaign of recent time . on August @card@ , @card@ - just over two month after 17.4million Brits have vote to leave the EU - Mr Jozwik , a Polish national living and work in Harlow , be out drink with friend . at around 11.30pm they clash with some local teen . there be an argument and one of the teen , then @card@ , punch Mr Jozwik in the head . he fall and hit his skull on the pavement , suffer serious brain injury and never regain consciousness . he die two day later in Addenbrooke ' S hospital , Cambridge . for certain political and media type , still reel from the electorate ' s rejection of the EU , this be more than just a drunken dispute that end tragically - it be an act of political evil . instantly , and without the benefit of evidence , they label Mr Jozwik ' s death a Brexit crime . for the Remain-leaning press , the killing bolster both their prejudice that the ` ` low-information ' ' rabble who vote to leave be drive by anti-immigrant sentiment , and their warning that Brexit would embolden them to be more openly racist . Jakub Krupa , of the Polish Press Agency , write in the Guardian that the killing ` ` expose the reality of post-referendum racism ' ' . European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker also use it to attack Brexit . he tell the European Parliament : ` ` we European can never accept Polish worker be harass , beat up or even murder on the street of Essex . ' ' Robert Halfon , Tory MP for Harlow , say the killing show that some people ` ` from the sewer ' ' be use Brexit to ` ` exploit division ' ' . meanwhile , the leftish Twittersphere go into meltdown . tweet included ` ` welcome to Brexit Britain ' ' ' ' ( Jozwik Britain . ` ` , be ) murder for be Polish ' ' , and ` ` this be what be encourage by Farage , Johnson , Cameron . ' ' the Polish ambassador to the UK , Arkady Rzegocki , say Mr Jozwik ' S death be cause by hate , and there would be ` ` much more after Brexit ' ' . but it be n't true . none of it . this cynical narrative about Brexit cause Mr Jozwik ' S death be build on lie , misinformation and prejudice . the trial of the Harlow teenager who have punch Mr Jozwik have not even take place . the political abuse of this killing start to unravel in December last year , when it be reveal that the Crown Prosecution Service would not be treat it as a hate crime . the CPS suggest there be no who punch Mr Jozwik be evidence that the ` ` shrimp ' ' of a lad drive by anti-Polish prejudice . not only that , it also be n't murder . the charge be manslaughter . the subsequent trial of the teen , who can not be name for legal reason , make it clear that this be just a tragic , late-night incident with no political undertone at all . and that Mr Jozwik be not an entirely innocent party in the row . evidence in court suggest that he and his friend ` ` appear to be drink and smell of alcohol ' ' . blood test show Mr Jozwik be around twice the drink-drive limit . in court , the boy responsible for the killer punch claim the Polish man be ` ` aggressive and loud ' ' and say : ` ` fight me , fight me . ' ' he also say it be the Poles who use racist language . he say one of the Polish man grab a friend of his and call him a ` ` n***** ' ' . he add that he be ` ` scared ' ' and ` ` I just do n't know what they be go to do next ' ' . a scuffle ensue and CCTV show him punch Mr Jozwik from behind . Patrick Upward , for the defence , tell the court : ` ` the deceased and his companion , accord to witness , be staggering from drink . ` ` they make racist remark to the youth and invite violence ... and they be considerably big and strong than the young people . ` ` it be after the deceased push one of the youngster that this defendant do what he do . ' ' even prosecutor Rosina Cottage QC say : ` ` the prosecution do not say that [ the youth ] think for a moment that what he do would result in the death of a man . ' ' accord to psychological report the boy regret his action and feel remorse over Mr Jozwik ' S death . he do not mean to kill him . what have be present as a Brexit-linked , hateful murder be nothing of the kind . even Mr Jozwik ' S brother Radek , @card@ , say the killing be not racist . speak of his relative who live in Britain , he tell the Sun : ` ` none of us have ever suffer any racism . ` ` I never think his death be race-related . I think he be in the wrong place at the wrong time . English people have always be friendly and welcome . ' ' last week , that Harlow teenager be sentence to three-and-a-half year in a young offender ' institution , for manslaughter . the people who make such a big political deal of Mr Jozwik ' s death at the time say nothing . perhaps they be too ashamed that they exploit a tragedy to score political point . ashamed that , as they rail against the alleged prejudice of Brexit Britain , they reveal their own prejudice - their snobby fear and loathing of the people of Britain whose only ` ` crime ' ' be to reject the EU and vote for more democracy .

Boris amnesty for illegal just reward crime I Ca N'T believe that Boris Johnson - who spearhead the ` ` take back control ' ' Brexit campaign - want an amnesty for illegal immigrant who have be here for ten year . this must never be allow . that these people have evade detection for that amount of time be a damn testament to our own weak border control and immigration enforcement . ten year without detection , hide in plain sight , be a disgrace and should not be see as something to reward . these people have enter the country illegally . they be criminal and should be track down and deport . Dave Hughes Pontefract , West York Boris Johnson ' S call for an amnesty for thousand of illegal immigrant be NOT what Brexit fan want to hear . he be well aware that immigration be one of the key issue among Brexit plan . so his idea of an amnesty for everyone who have sneak into Britain will only inflame the situation . a Cabinet minister warn that the ` ` insane idea ' ' would make ordinary brit furious . yeah , 17million of us . Mick BIDEWELL Newcastle upon Tyne I THOUGHT Boris Johnson be for leave and work hard to give us Brexit . but now I have my doubt . we vote leave because we be concern about immigration and the million of pound it have cost in housing , job , benefit , school , the NHS and so on - and what it be still cost .

the Sun SAYS Brexit buffoon THE Sun have some advice for Ireland ' s naive young prime minister : shut your gob and grow up . Leo Varadkar may not like Brexit . so what ? he need to accept it ' S happening . his priority should not be pick hole in our position . it should be help make Brexit work for million of his citizen and ours , include by engage constructively on a border solution . he be too busy disrespect 17.4million voter of a country whose billion stop Ireland go bust as recently as @card@ . a country on which so much of his economy depend . we be Ireland ' s big trading partner and near neighbour . the effect of a ` ` hard Brexit ' ' could be catastrophic . yet Varadkar ' s rookie diplomacy , puerile insult and threat to veto trade negotiation be bring it ever closer . we can only assume his arrogance stem from a delusion that he can single-handedly stop Brexit . indeed Ireland ' s political establishment clearly believe we can be force to vote the ` ` right ' ' way at a second referendum , just as they make their citizen do over the EU Lisbon Treaty they initially reject . it be not go to happen . David Davis rightly name France and Germany as the roadblock to progress , even as other EU nation want a deal . he should not overlook the showboating obstinacy of Ireland ' s Varadkar , a man increasingly out of his depth .

stop dance it ' S just week till the Brexit process be trigger and Nicola Sturgeon be still dance around the issue of a second independence referendum . yesterday she claim there be a Tory government plot to strike at the very heart of devolution by use Brexit as an excuse to claw power away from Holyrood . she have in mind power over area like fishery and farming which currently lie at Brussels . those control will come back to the UK after Brexit - and since farming and fishing be both devolve area , perhaps they should , by right , transfer automatically to Scotland . the big aspect of these responsibility be , of course , the money . who will decide how much money be spend on farm subsidy and who get it ? Scottish farmer get a huge chunk of EU subsidy - much more than our population share would allow - and changing that could , quite literally , alter the landscape of Scotland . but Holyrood do n't currently control fishing quota . we ' re not go to miss what we ' ve never have . Ms Sturgeon have be the voice of reason since the Brexit vote , urge consensus and a middle way while , at the same time , swing the baseball bat of indyref2 quietly behind her back . but her patience be begin to sound an awful lot like reluctance . the vote have be ` ` highly likely ' ' , ` ` increasingly likely ' ' , ` ` almost unavoidable ' ' and , yesterday , it be ` ` almost necessary ' ' . with Brexit loom , a decision must be make . on the other hand , we be week away from the SNP conference . be that when the conditional tense of ` ` maybe ' ' will turn into the tense condition of another referendum ?

may have To EMBRACE BREXIT REBELS THE Government ' s defeat on a Brexit amendment this week be embarrassing . it show the limit of Theresa May ' S authority . the question now be whether this rebellion lead to more or not . as one minister put it : ` ` successful rebellion either increase the appetite for it or concentrate mind . ' ' at the top of government , they be console themselves with the thought that though they lose this vote , the defeat have reveal what really motivate some of the rebel . one well-place Tory tell me ` ` Dominic and Soubs ' ' - the leader of the rebellion the former Attorney General Dominic Grieve and the former minister Anna Soubry , both below - ` ` have show their true colour this week . this be n't about meaningful amendment , but block Brexit . ' ' they hope this revelation will help them peel off some of the other rebel . they believe that most realise just how dangerous stopping , or dilute beyond recognition , Brexit would be . but there be lesson the government should learn from this defeat . first of all , the whipping do n't get it right . the whip have a hard task and it be not make easier by have a deputy chief whip , Esther McVey , who have never whip before . it be also bizarre to have the good TV performer in the Tory party - she be a breakfast TV presenter before become an MP - in a job where they be not allow to go on the medium . May also need to show these rebel that there be a way back . when she reshuffle her team , she should make a point of bring one of them back into the fold .
the Sun SAYS Blair-faced liar Tony Blair have tell some brazen lie in his time but yesterday ' s stomach-churn dishonesty on Brexit be putrid even for him . it be n't just the fact that he twist . it ' s his feign concern for democracy , his forked-tongued duplicity about give voter the ` ` right to rethink ' ' any Brexit deal - when his ONLY motive be secure the chance to negate their first decision and reverse the tide of history . who do this fade snake oil salesman imagine he and his revolting underling Mandelson , Adonis and Campbell still represent ? surely not the ` ` Remain resistance ' ' , since every we-know-best utterance convert Remainers into Leavers . Brexit be in part the final revolt against Blair ' s disastrous misjudgement . he mislead us all and invade Iraq . he fling open our border . he let his weird Chancellor Gordon Brown ' s borrowing wreck the economy , necessitate austerity . then Blair line his pocket - return only to try to sabotage the big democratic mandate in our history . the Brexit poll have barely move since . but one survey have a significant finding : that a loathing of Blair unite majority of Leavers , Remainers , Tory , Labour and Lib-Dem voter , male and female , of every age and class , in every region of England , Scotland and Wales . who exactly do he think he still have the power to persuade ? more seriously , how can he be so delude as to imagine Brexit can be painlessly reverse after all the vote cast for it by the public and Parliament ? it would trigger constitutional meltdown , a total collapse of trust in democracy and an eruption of violence . a Sun front page once ask if Blair be ` ` the most dangerous man in Britain ' ' . he now seem to aspire to it . thank God so few still listen to him .

Tories must tell us what Brexit mean it be an early start for Cabinet on Tuesday . before the meeting proper they have @card@ minute of polling on the state of the Tory party . it do n't make for cheerful viewing . David Mundell , the Scottish Secretary , sum up the mood of the meeting when he tell Theresa May , to chuckle , that his first impression from all the datum be that she should n't call an election any time soon . the problem for the Tories be voter be wary of their value and feed up with austerity . ` ` it be the age-old Conservative problem , that we ' re bring in to clean up the mess and once people feel that ' s do they be not sure they want us , ' ' be how one of those present sum it up . one Remain-voting Secretary of State tell me they be surprise to find that concern about public service appear to have do more damage to the Tory brand than Brexit . I ' m tell the presentation show a ` ` disproportionate number of people who vote Remain go Labour but the principal driver of that be n't Brexit but public service ' ' . ( some present dispute this interpretation . ) Prosperous Britain the fascinating question be , what account for this shift ? in @card@ , the fact the Tories have a plan to the tackle the deficit be a strength for them and a weakness for Labour . but just two year later the opposite be true . voter be feed up with austerity . one minister put this down to the ` ` impatience ' ' of modern politics . voter simply think deficit reduction have go on too long and that , ` ` you should have sort this by now ' ' . the other electoral conundrum for the Tories be that the great hostility to Jeremy Corbyn be among traditional Labour voter , not those who switch to Labour at the last election . this suggest the Tories ' good chance of win a majority at the next election lie in traditionally Labour seat where the Tories come close last time , such as Bishop Auckland , in the North East , which Labour have hold since @card@ I be tell Gavin Barwell , the PM ' s chief of staff , be particularly convince of this . so , what should the Tory do ? well , firstly stop argue among themselves . the Cabinet be repeatedly remind that the less united it be , the less the public will think of them as a competent government . the next thing they need be a positive vision , to show the public what they be for . they must show voter how they want the country to be different after Brexit . but the problem be , as one influential Cabinet minister put it : ` ` You ' ve get to feel it to communicate it . ' ' so Theresa May - who vote Remain - find it hard to argue with passion that Brexit will lead to a happy , more prosperous Britain . she be not alone in this problem . one of those intimately involve in draw up the Tories ' electoral strategy lament that the top three people in the government be all ambivalent or negative about Brexit . indeed , Mrs May ' S deputy , Damian Green , have make it clear he would vote Remain again . while no one could confuse Philip Hammond , with his regular dire warning about the economic consequence of diverge from the EU , with a Brexit enthusiast . but the government must explain what Brexit be for . if it do n't , the voter simply wo n't understand why they be spend so much time on it , rather than bread-and-butter domestic issue . lJames Forsyth be political editor of the Spectator

should Brits be brick it over Brexit ? ; How EU Vote COULD AFFECT Property MARKET WE may be face a sizzling summer but the hot topic of today have to be Brexit . with the referendum loom , and scaremongering rife , would-be property purchaser might be forgive for sit on the garden fence . but what will happen to the property market after June @card@ ? how will our vote , in or out , impact on the affordability of home and their value ? even before we get to the vote , there be sign that the uncertainty surround the result could be have an effect on the investor market , which ultimately filter down to the rest of us . in London especially , jittery overseas investor be stay away , with some even abandon property they have already reserve with a deposit . UK-based private investor have also slow down their activity . so demand be soften , which mean price could too . but what be the overall implication for the rest of us ? here be my Brexit FAQs : what will happen to mortgage rate after the vote ? if we choose Brexit , as Boris Johnson and Co propose , the political uncertainty that will follow will put the UK economy under pressure , and as such , it will be hard to see how the Bank of England would be able to increase interest rate . on the other hand , stay in Europe - as PM David Cameron want us to - when the rest of the Eurozone be still struggle with lukewarm economic performance be not an environment in which interest rate be likely to be raise any time soon . so my money be on low interest rate for the foreseeable future . what will happen to property price in the UK ? a vote for Brexit be likely to lead to a short-term negative impact on the City of London . as a result , London property price could get hit hard , which would have a ripple effect on the rest of the UK housing market . however that would increase affordability , so one result might be that firsttime buyer be able to climb on to the property ladder in location that be financially out of their reach previously . David Catt , of property market analyst Hometrack , say : ` ` if the UK leave the EU , it would create a prolonged period of uncertainty , lead to reduce demand , which , consider supply onsidering the tight supy of housing in the UK , ould feed quickly to house price nd result in a ajor slowdown in e rate of growth . ' ' ot necessarily a ad thing . could into and major the not bad what about hat e availbility the availability of housing ? potentially , Brexit threaten City ' s shortterm therefore availability fund home-that price developer ousing ? Potenally , a rexit vote reatens the ty ' s shortrm stability , and erefore also the vailability of nds for further ome-building . another risk be at if property rice fall , develpers will not want build home in a arket of downward rice . the only way to itigate this would be overnment-sponsored fordable mortgage . interestingly , in the un-up to the referendum the onstruction sector have slow its low level for almost ree year . many firm early seem unwilling to ommit to new project in the hort term , and builder be king on subcontractor ther than hire staff while ey wait to see what hapens . the drop in home-buildg will mean more people hasing limited stock , which ould push price back up . to market price . mitigate Government-affordable run-construction to three clearly commit short take rather they happen . build hat propty chasing could what will happen to property purchasing cost ? this have very little to do with very decision , of if try increase revenue . while referendum ith the vote . cost be ry much a government ecision , and give the state the economy , I predict that the government can , it will y to find a way to crease tax and raise venue . in a nutshell , hile the referenum be be ayed out , and ere be a lull in roperty activity nderpinned by ncertainty , the pportunists among you might e in luck . with the low ortgage rate on cord , now might be a nique chance to nip there , negoate a good rice and ab e eal of lifeme . play there property underpin uncertainty , opportunist be mortgage record , unique in negotiate price grab the deal a lifetime .

the Sun SAYS Hard to fault the so-called ` ` hard Brexit ' ' letter back by @card@ Tory MP make sound sense to us . that ' S because ` ` hard Brexit ' ' be just ` ` Brexit ' ' . and we have make the same suggestion ourselves . the letter demand a strict timetable for leave the single market and custom union . quite right . there be no Brexit without that . it insist any transition period must not be prolonged by the EU against our will . and it demand we be free to sign our own trade agreement during that time . that will enrage Brussels . but it be crucial we can at least negotiate those deal , ready to sign the day we finally leave . we do n't envy Theresa May , catch in the crossfire between resolute Brexiters and scheming Remainers try to scupper the vital EU Withdrawal Bill . thankfully her position , like most of Britain ' S , be near the former than the latter .
the Sun SAYS Brexit wrecker REMAINERS say Brexit be already chaos . who be cause it , apart from them ? the government position on the single market and custom union be clear . and the intention of the new repeal bill , to adopt all EU law and amend it post- Brexit if need be , be harmless . but Remainers be bend on sabotage it . not because it be a genuine threat , but because they want Brexit to collapse . every day the deadline get closer . every obstacle throw up harm our prospect . meanwhile Jeremy Corbyn turn up in Brussels to hold his own EU ` ` negotiation ' ' . what for ? we have a government . he ' S not in it . all his little stunt achieve be to embarrass his country . perhaps that ' S why the EU indulge him .

we vote , now get on with it ; PM Must Stop BREXIT DITHERING Just get on with it ! that be the consistent message from leave voter up and down the country . for such people , it ' S simple : ` ` there be a vote , the leave side won and now the UK have to leave the www.EU.No if or but . ' ' it ' s an instruction that our MP would do well to heed , and one that permeate all the finding from a fascinating series of focus group that I have be show . Change Britain , a new Eurosceptic campaign , have be speak to voter in Yorkshire , the Midlands , the North East and North West . one of the most striking finding be the complete absence of any buyer ' remorse . those who vote to quit the EU be happy , their frustration stem purely from the stall of the Brexit process and finger-wagging , preachy Remainers say it ca n't be do . many have be supportive of Theresa May , who be say the right thing , but patience be wear thin . many be demand ` ` a plan ' ' and some ` ` action ' ' . plenty be upset at the lack of communication , smell a rat . there be a widespread suspicion that a deeply untrustworthy establishment be prepare to sell them out . the tragic , explosive reality be that ordinary leave voter be right - Brexit be on the verge of go badly wrong , even though the economy have be astonishingly resilient since the vote . the Remainers be on the march , with Tony Blair and his vast financial and human resource return to the fray , the legal complication relate to Article @card@ be become ridiculously onerous and foreign leader be make the most of our divided , unsettled establishment to humiliate Britain as often as possible . Barack Obama ' s infamous intervention before the referendum backfire . it be a fair bet that the Maltese prime minister who want the UK to ` ` be bad off ' ' or the Polish foreign minister who say we may never leave the EU will have drive many into an even great rage . Angela Merkel ' s decision to block any fast-track deal over European expats be ment this week , as be the me lawyer believe that the a seminal moment news that some Supreme Court could yet allow Scotland or even the European Court of Justice to have the final say over Article @card@ . the reason so many Remainers now feel able openly to undermine Brexit be because the government have allow itself to portray Britain as a supplicant , a divided , rudderless country . to European diplomat it look as if our government ' S heart be not really in this and that our strategy be purely defensive , a bid to retain as close link to the EU as possible . many lead pro-Brexit activist and MP be furious , even though they remain loyal to the Prime Minister . the first obvious sign of Eurosceptics flex their muscle come in the form of a letter by @card@ Tory backbench MP demand a clean or ` ` hard ' ' Brexit , complete with withdrawal from the single market and the custom union . Change Britain have already sign up close to @card@ supporter . its good recruiting day be when the government lose its case in the High Court . staff by Vote leave alumnus , Change Britain be rebuild a network of ground campaign team and organiser across the UK . the stall and leafleting have restart , as have the digital and social medium push . crucially , the next action day in December will target constituency of anti- Brexit MP . Ukip may be in a parlous financial state but the ability of new leader Paul Nuttall to connect with ex-Labour work class and low middle class voter be be underestimate . some @card@ Labour MP hold seat that back Brexit , more than half the party ' S total . and at some point if Article @card@ end up get bogged down in Parliament , somebody - perhaps insurance millionaire Arron Banks - will begin to finance an aggressive , populist campaign group dedicate to oust any MP who defy the will of the public . all of this mean the Prime Minister will have to act quickly to prevent the situation from spiral out of control if the Supreme Court rule against her in the Article @card@ case , which be be hear next week . a decision be expect in January . she will first have to mount a public , vigorous and passionate defence of Brexit as a positive , epoch-defining choice . she will have to start to throw Britain ' S weight around , and slap down internal and external critic . she need to explain that while it would be mutually beneficial for the UK and the EU to agree a transitional deal when we leave , an inability to do so would n't be the end of the world . she will have to make it clear that she see the possibility of a free-trade deal with the US as a huge opportunity - one that she will start work on immediately - and that she wish to diversify the UK away from Europe economically and geopolitically . she will then have to apply maximal pressure on Tory MP to back her and be prepare to be pitiless with the House of Lords . but most important of all , she need to work out how she would engineer a General Election early in the new year , if all else fail . the Tories be more popular than anybody can remember , with the country in the midst of a historic shift to the right , cause in large part by the fact that the pro-Brexit majority still believe that Theresa May will deliver for them . she can not afford to let them down , even if that means take the great gamble of her career .

Brexit to hit club in pocket former city trader Mark Warburton believe the Brexit vote will hit British football in the pocket . but he think there ' S so much money in the English game it ' ll hardly matter .

Britain TRIGGERS BREXIT ; Donnelly : FG WAR ON Enda RISKY AS. . can Govt fight Ireland ' S corner ? fine Gael ' S decision to throw Enda Kenny ` ` under a bus ' ' be damage Ireland ' s chance of win a good deal on Brexit . Fianna Fail TD Stephen Donnelly make the claim in today ' S Irish Sun - just as UK Prime Minister Theresa May trigger Article @card@ to start the clock on our neighbour ' s withdrawal from the European Union . with the process now under way , we can reveal that : senior Irish official have not seek a ` ` special status ' ' for Northern Ireland , ruling out any chance of the six county be treat differently than Britain in negotiation . more than @card@ meeting have be hold with EU country to explain the Common Travel Area , an almost century-old agreement that allow free movement between Ireland and the UK , include for work . there be ` ` some apprehension and nervousness ' ' among some member state about the CTA ' s status post-Brexit . Enda Kenny will meet with @card@ other EU member state leader on April @card@ to outline a common position when the Brexit bargaining begin in earnest . and despite immense pressure to name his own exit date as Taoiseach , he have insist that he may remain in charge for the start of the EU-UK talk , schedule for the end of May or start of June . only then would he allow a leadership contest to take place , with Leo Varadkar and Simon Coveney the frontrunner . Stephen Donnelly , the former Social Democrats co-leader who recently join Fianna Fail as their Brexit spokesman , tell us that the linger leadership question be hurt Ireland ' s negotiate position . he say : ` ` the Taoiseach be well regard in Europe . he be good at relationship and he have his moment . his speech in the White House be a great speech . ` ` he should be applaud for it , and he be the second-longest head of state in the EU28 and he be well regard . ` ` and when you be as small as Ireland you do need goodwill . and he have goodwill . ` ` I would not be so bold to comment as to who Fine Gael should have as their leader . but I do think not have have a Brexit Minister be now bite Ireland badly . ` ` what we be always tell be , ' Enda ' s our guy , he ' S get the relationship . it be all about Heads of State ' . ` ` but the same people who tell us that have just throw him under a bus . he be not go to be our leader . ` ` a new Taoiseach will come into place , let ' s say July . they will have a Cabinet reshuffle . it take anyone , no matter how hard you work , a good six month to get on top of the brief . ` ` so we be into the next January before we have a coherent group , and then everyone be look at the next general election . it be chaos . ` ` Had they have a Brexit Minister they could have at least maintain the role the whole way through . Ireland be be damage by internal fine Gael politics . ' ' Key to the talk be Northern Ireland , which stand to be the region most acutely affect by the divorce process and its aftermath . Sinn Fein have call for a ` ` special status for the North within the EU ' ' , which would include access to the Single Market , retain peace funding and access to agriculture and fishery cash , as well as representation on the EU Council of Ministers .

Brexit can be slow ... long as we get there the Brexit negotiation finally start on Monday . when Theresa May call the election , she hope that her win a big majority would bolster the UK ' s position in these talk . in fact , the opposite have happen . she lose the Tories their majority , there ' s renew uncertainty about what the UK Government ' s Brexit policy be and many in Europe smell blood . the great Tory divide over the EU have be reopen by the election result . inside Cabinet , there be argument rage about what kind of Brexit to seek . ` ` people be have another go at the old argument , ' ' admit one weary No10 www.source.No one be be more vocal in this regard than the Chancellor Philip Hammond . since the election , the Chancellor - who Mrs May would have sack if she ' d win big - have be flex his muscle . Leave-supporting minister be furious about his behaviour . one say that if Hammond succeed in water down Brexit then he will cause ` ` a schism in the Tory party ' ' and multiple Cabinet minister will resign . he complain that the only beneficiary of this will be Jeremy Corbyn . in Downing Street , some suspect that Hammond be most interested in get his own back for the dismissive attitude May and her team take towards him before the election . ` ` he ' S still smart and feel very sore about the way he ' s be treat , ' ' one senior figure admit . this figure say that Hammond be ` ` articulate a strong Treasury opinion which never be that keen on exit the EU ' ' . No10 , though , insist that government policy remain the same : that Britain will still leave the EU , the single market and the custom union . indeed , the Labour idea that the UK should leave the single market but stay in the custom union be absurd . it would mean that the UK would have leave the single market but would not be able to strike its own trade deal around the world , remove one of the big economic opportunity that Brexit offer . but if the policy be n't change , the pace at which it happen be up for debate . ` ` that ' S where the space be , ' ' one senior Treasury source tell me . one of those intimately involve in the government ' s Brexit strategy say that ` ` the PM have always say a transition period be fine . but we can be more candid about that now ' ' . previously , the aim be to have the whole transition wrap up within three year , by the time of the next General Election in @card@ . this mean that the Tories would go into that campaign with UK budget payment to the EU end , the UK fully in control of its own immigration policy and the European Court of Justice no longer have jurisdiction over the UK . but there be now sign that opinion on this in Government be move . when I put it to one of those drawing up the UK ' s negotiate strategy that the transition might have to be extend beyond the next election , I be tell ` ` that argument be become more plausible ' ' . ally of the Scottish Tory leader Ruth Davidson , who with her @card@ MP be now hugely influential in the Tory party , say she be keen on the idea of a long transition , too . it would also help deliver the ` ` smooth Brexit ' ' that the DUP , on whose vote Theresa May must now rely , want . leaver should not set themselves against any kind of extended transition . as long as it be time-limited - and so ca n't leave the UK in permanent limbo - and result in the UK regain control over policy and the right to make trade deal around the world , it could work . what matter most be the destination , not how quickly we get there . l James Forsyth be political editor of the Spectator .

put the BREX ON ; UK in CHAOS NATS and Tory Chiefs Tell May To Go SOFT ; lNic urge total rethink on Euro split Theresa May must have a total rethink on Brexit after voter ` ` tell her where to go ' ' Nicola Sturgeon warn yesterday . the First Minister say the embattled PM should be force into a climbdown on EU split negotiation in the wake of her General Election humiliation . she insist Mrs May must back a soft Brexit , include stay in the single market and guarantee EU citizen in Britain can keep live here . the Nat leader say : ` ` I have bang my head off the brick wall of Downing Street for the past year for a UK-wide approach and she have refuse . ` ` she have pay the price for her intransigence . she go to the country ask for a mandate and the country tell her where to go . ` ` she can not simply carry on as if nothing have change . ' ' Ms Sturgeon turn the screw on the Prime Minister during a visit to Westminster . ' Brexit should n't mean sacrifice job ' issue a list of demand , she tell Mrs May - who have previously snub devolve administration get a seat at the Brexit table - the electorate have back the Tory into a corner . she say : ` ` the Prime Minister ask for a strengthened mandate and voter across the UK refuse to give her that . ` ` Brexit should n't mean sacrifice people ' S job and sacrifice living standard . ` ` let ' s resolve to stay in the single market and the custom union because that make sense for the economy . ` ` I be call for a cross-party approach that have the single market at its heart . ' ' but Downing Street last night vow there would be no U-turn from the PM despite lose her Commons majority on Thursday . a No10 spokesman say the government be target the good deal for all of the UK , insist there be ` ` no change to these plan ' ' . he add : ` ` we give a commitment at the very outset of this process to consult with devolve administration and that remain the case . ` ` Our position have be set out and that be where we be . ` ` we want to achieve the well possible deal for the whole of the United Kingdom . ' ' the Brexit bust-up emerge as Ms Sturgeon meet her party ' S @card@ MP outside Parliament . the First Minister - wear a blue dress and jacket combo - smile and wave as she join member , include acting Westminster leader Stewart Hosie . she then heap extra pressure on Mrs May by propose a rainbow pact to scupper the imminent Tory and DUP alliance . but the unlikely move - on the day the Queen ' S Speech be delay - would still require backing from the ten right-wing Ulster MP . Ms Sturgeon say : ` ` question have be raise about what have be cook up behind closed door and be it possible for this Prime Minister - notwithstanding what she say on Friday - to put together a government that be functional and sustainable . it be an opportunity perhaps . ` ` I know the arithmetic - I be not blind to the hurdle - but it perhaps mean an opportunity for a progressive alternative to a Tory/ DUP government . ' ' but she refuse to discuss plan for a second indy vote after rival claim the SNP ' s loss of @card@ seat be a protest against a @card@ re-run . she say : ` ` I will reflect on the outcome of the election and I will do that carefully and in discussion with colleague across the SNP . ` ` I wo n't do it to a timetable dictate by headline-hungry journalist or base on any overly simplistic analysis of the election .

Brexit work permit will work wonder to slash migration WE be get our first glimpse of how immigration will work after Brexit . that first glimpse be encourage . the new rule look fair , effective , reasonable and well time . fair because they recognise the right of EU national already here . effective because by deny in-work benefit to new entrant , they will reduce overall number . reasonable because key sector of our economy will still be able to hire the talent they need . well time because the new rule will apply to people who arrive after next month . if we wait until Brexit formally take effect in @card@ , there would be a rush to beat the deadline . most brit - include most who vote Remain - want immigration to be regulate . we understand that control our border do n't mean close them . we just want to feel we be in charge of who come in and in what number . the proposal by Theresa May , inset , be ambitious and balanced . EU national want to get job in the UK will be entitle to a five-year work permit , which can be renew . but they will no longer be able to claim payment such as tax credit , income support , housing benefit and help with council tax . nor will they be able to send child benefit to kid in their home country who have never set foot here . it be hard to argue against these restriction . indeed , many EU national already in the UK say they want to tighten up the benefit rule . our welfare system be base on the idea that we fill a common pot with our tax when we be work and draw from that pot at time of need . it plainly can not work if 60million brit be fill the pot but 500million EU citizen can empty it . the wonder be that other EU state be happy to keep the rule on common welfare claim - rule which be , in many case , invent by Eurocrats and Euro-judges rather than approve by their own minister . we shall welcome worker we will still welcome EU national who want to bring their talent here . many of our industry be worldbeating - the chemical , audio-visual , educational , scientific , legal and financial sector , for example . the good and bright people in the world often choose to work here and the new rule will barely affect qualified professional . indeed , while controlling EU immigration , we should make it easy for skilled non-EU national to get work permit in these key industry . there be also sector with shortage at a low wage level . for example , much of the hospitality industry depend on people who come to work here for a time , as do part of the NHS . a lot of agricultural work be seasonal and , in practice , be do by EU national . it be economic to bring in fruit picker by bus from Slovakia or Poland ; it be not feasible to fly them in from Bangladesh . these sector , too , should be happy with the new rule , which will allow them to find the worker they need . overall , number will still fall , though , because the removal of in-work benefit will make British job less attractive to EU worker . if you come to the UK from , say , Romania , and top up your salary with tax credit and other inwork benefit , you be good off on the minimum wage here than on the average wage at home . remove the top-ups and the work become a lot less lucrative . this be especially true because the pound be no longer overvalued , mean a British salary be worth less when convert into Romanian leu . the fall in number will be largely account for by unskilled EU migrant , of whom around @card@ a year arrive without a job offer . it wo n't affect doctor , engineer or scientist . nor will it affect EU national already here , whose right the government be keen to confirm , provide it get the same deal for the much small number of brit live in the EU . my guess be that almost every other electorate in Europe would prefer such a system to the free movement that Brussels insist on . but they be not give that option because their political leader care more about a unite Europe than about sensible immigration control . in refuse to budge , those political leader risk a real backlash . not the moderate reform that Britain be now contemplate , but an outbreak of populist anger that could lead to border closure and expulsion . Britain have find a good way . we shall continue to welcome worker from Europe but we shall do so on our www.terms.No longer will Euro-judges tell us whom we must admit and whom we may deport . we will decide who get to stay . what could be more reasonable ? l Daniel Hannan be a Conservative MEP for South East England Afghan peace can end exodus to UK - Page @card@

BREXIT ' S A Grey Area for Davis THE Brexit Secretary David Davis joke to Tory MP on Wednesday night that there be only two people age over @card@ in his department . he explain that this be why he want to hire some more experienced figure to work on the negotiation , and from outside the civil service if necessary . the old member of the Cabinet might have be exaggerate for comic effect . but the Brexit department , which only have half the staff it need at the moment , do need some old , more experienced type . for Brexit to work , Whitehall need to ensure that the department do n't just have bright young thing , but also those with experience of complicated international negotiation . the presence of 67-year-old Davis do guarantee , though , that there will be at least some grey hair on the negotiate team .
Brexit trio to share mansion Civil servant fear firework after the three Brexit Cabinet minister be order to share the same official retreat . Boris Johnson , David Davis and Liam Fox will all use Chevening , a 17th century pile in Kent , to entertain world leader in Brexit negotiation . the set-up between the Foreign , Brexit and International Trade Secretaries be dub ` ` good sitcom ever ' ' on social medium . the mansion , near Sevenoaks , have traditionally be the Foreign Secretary ' S retreat . quiz on how the share will work , the PM ' S spokeswoman say : ` ` I ' m sure they will be able to work together on that . ' ' in Downing Street , PM Theresa May will take the large apartment over No11 while Chancellor Philip Hammond will live above No10 . Boris Johnson have to bin his Â£275,000-ayear Daily Telegraph deal and shelve a book say to be worth Â£500,000 due to his Cabinet role .
May must see Brexit as a great chance , not a problem Theresa May will be Britain ' S next Prime Minister if she can sound confident and optimistic about Brexit . May ' s most obvious weakness in this contest be that she back Remain , while most Tory member go for Brexit . Andrea Leadsom ' S supporter be convince that bang this referendum drum offer her a route to victory . ` ` the membership be sceptical and she talk their language , ' ' say one former minister who be support her . this be why it be imperative that May make clear that now the voter have deliver their verdict , she view leave the EU as an opportunity to be seize , not a risk to be manage . in the next few day , her Brexiteer supporter - include Liam Fox , Priti Patel , David Davis and her campaign chairman Chris Grayling - will all be out and about say that it be she who can deliver exit . but May herself need to sound upbeat , to not let Leadsom be the candidate of hope and change . ` ` the membership know Theresa . but it do n't know Andrea yet , she ' S get room to grow , ' ' one of Leadsom ' S confidant tell me . they want to emphasise her warmth , create a contrast between Leadsom the mother who have a career before politics and May , who first stand for Parliament nearly a quarter of a century ago . the most effective way for May to counter this be to make clear that she have the chop and the will to get trade deal do with the fastgrowing part of the world economy . her trump card against Leadsom be her experience . Leadsom have be a minister for two year . May have be on the Tory front bench for @card@ year and Home Secretary for six . be this moment in Britain ' S history , with the most complex negotiation of the post-war era ahead of us , the right time for a novice ? perhaps , though , the big risk for May be her record on immigration . she have n't hit the Tory target of cut net migration to the ten of thousand once in her six year at the Home Office . this be n't just down to EU migration either , non-EU migration be @card@ a year at the moment . Leadsom - unlike Boris , Osborne and Gove - have n't be an advocate of liberal immigration policy , so will find it easy to attack May for this failure . this will be a very different campaign from the one that May expect to fight . for year , she have be set herself up to run against a male opponent - a Boris or an Osborne . parliamentary boy ' club her message have be that she ' S a serious , unshowy politician who do n't treat politics as a game and be n't part of the Westminster set . but now May be take on another woman , it do n't matter that she be n't part of the parliamentary boy ' club because her opponent be n't either . which be another reason why May ca n't cede optimism to Leadsom . MRS May know that one of her weakness be that she ' s regard as a micromanager . so she ' s be busy this week try to reassure Tory that she ' ll bring back proper Cabinet government and there wo n't be a Blair , or Cameron-style , kitchen Cabinet . one of those who work for Cameron and be now sign up with May have already notice one difference in how the two team work . he have tell colleague that ` ` they even sit round table for meeting ' ' . the era of sofa government might be come to an end .

the Sun SAYS talk Junck THERE be viper more trustworthy than serial liar Jean-Claude Juncker . Theresa May can learn from his treacherous , one-sided , self-serving leak of the alleged detail of their private dinner at Downing Street . first lesson : never , ever repeat the experience . it be profoundly depress that this bluster Euro-toad have any part in the Brexit process . he be contemptuous of democracy , admit he will cheerfully deceive million of EU voter if it serve Brussels ' blinkered interest . ` ` when it become serious , you have to lie , ' ' read his most infamous quote . we can be @card@ per cent sure , then , that he have grossly distort what go on at No10 and , more seriously , tell Angela Merkel the same tall tale . what be almost as repugnant yesterday be the shameful glee of diehard Remainers as they gullibly swallow Juncker ' S every last syllable , desperate for their prejudice to be confirm . they be will him on , willing Brussel on , hope their own Prime Minister fall flat on her face . why ? because it be more important to them to be prove ` ` right ' ' , to assert what they see as their intellectual and moral superiority over 17.4million Brexit voter , than it be for Britain to emerge with a decent deal and prosper thereafter . ultimately they hope we be humiliate so totally that we give up on Brexit . Juncker do too - he make no bone about it . his team hope brit ` ` wake up ' ' to the ` ` harsh reality ' ' before it ' S too late . talk to this delusional buffoon be therefore a waste of time . even by his own account he say nothing constructive at the meeting . he merely throw up obstacle and patronise Mrs May , leader of one of the world ' s great nation - one Europe have repeatedly rely on , and still do , for the security of its people . since Juncker remain convinced we will bottle out of Brexit if he be objectionable enough , maybe a big majority for Mrs May next month will sober him up . he could certainly do with it . Remainers say this ` ` transcript ' ' be ` ` damn ' ' . for who ? not the PM . she politely but firmly argue Britain ' S corner , be upbeat about overcome hurdle and talk up the need for both side to make Brexit a success . it WAS damn for the EU . it need Brexit to fail because it be petrify of its own collapse . its arrogance be a front for its insecurity . and there will be plenty more of it .
no go back ... so bring on the Brexit prophet of doom in the long war to free this country from our unelected , unwanted master in Brussels , last week we see the Normandy Landings . the point of no return . the turn in the tide of history . the moment when the end - still so far away - seem like a reality at last . MP vote by an overwhelming majority to start the process of leave the European Union . more than this , they vote - by @card@ to @card@ - to honour the democratic will of the British people . before the referendum , the government spend million tell us that our vote be final . yet still there be embitter soul - so use to get their way in their soft , pamper life - that believe they can stand in the way of democracy . but now Prime Minister Theresa May have the authority to trigger our divorce from the corrupt , crumble EU . now we be on the far side of D-Day . May , to her eternal credit , have change the narrative . all talk of ` ` hard Brexit ' ' and ` ` soft Brexit ' ' suddenly seem ludicrously old hat . we vote , in large number than we have ever vote for anything , to leave the EU . there be nothing on the ballot paper about hard , soft or squishy Brexit . there be only in or out . we choose out . and now there be only Brexit . we be make no attempt to cherry-pick the bit we like about EU membership . all we want be to get the hell out of this abusive relationship . ` ` suicide ! ' ' cry Labour MP Stephen Pound , one of those mouth-foaming , eye-swivelling Remoaners , as the vote be read out . yet if anyone be rush to top themselves then it be surely the Labour Party , which now reek with undisguised contempt for the will of the British people . here be Labour ' s great dilemma - it profess to represent ordinary British worker yet it believe the ordinary British worker be racist , stupid and horribly wrong about Brexit . why would anyone vote for a party that despise them ? Forty-seven Labour MP vote to halt Brexit , many in constituency where the man and woman who vote them in also vote to leave the European Union . Jeremy Corbyn ' s most loyal supporter , shadow home secretary Diane ` ` Sick note ' ' Abbott , fail to turn up for the historic vote , cite ` ` illness ' ' . a sudden bout of chronic Brexititis , Diane ? it can be very nasty . she be tweet away like a mad thing just an hour after be too poorly to vote . miraculous recovery ! thank god this repulsive Labour Party will never again be anywhere near form a government . there be nothing quite as sickening as a Labour MP who have suddenly twig that they be on the wrong side of history . guess what , Tulip ? Labour ' S Tulip Siddiq , who resign as shadow early year minister to oppose Corbyn ' s support for trigger Brexit , come out with the tired old Labour lie that the 17.4million brit who vote to leave the EU be xenophobic bigot . ` ` the reason why I ' m take the stand I ' m taking be because , in Hampstead and Kilburn , we do not wince when we hear people speak in a different language on public transport , ' ' simper Siddiq . Tulip Siddiq be my MP . guess what , Tulip ? I hear two language at the breakfast table . my wife be Asian . our daughter be mixed race . and you , Tulip , be exactly the kind of arrogant cretin that lose the referendum for leave . and you , Tulip , be exactly the kind of intellectual pygmy who will prevent Labour from ever win another General Election . so bring them all on . bring on the pompous democracy denier and their fresh legal challenge . bring on the splutter prophet of doom . bring on the Labour MP who loathe their most loyal supporter . bring on the threat of a Scottish Referendum . bring on Tony Blair , look more like a recently exhume corpse with every day . bring on purple-chopped Ken Clarke . bring on all of yesterday ' S man . and bring on the House of Lords - stuff full of democracy-loathing Lib Dem peer who still think they can keep us inside the EU . go ahead , your lordship - make our day ! Brexit be kill Labour and nobody will shed a tear if it also kill the House of Lords . we be off the beach and into the field . and nothing can stop Brexit now .

Brexit wo n't break trade I do N'T struggle to know what Brexit mean - it be to take back control of our own destiny . at the time of vote leave , I be fully aware there might be an economic price to pay . what I do struggle with be the attitude of those who treat as gospel what EU negotiator Michel Barnier and his cohort have to say about the UK in assert its own authority . he ' S like a stuck record , always threaten ` ` consequence ' ' . he say it ' s not possible to achieve a frictionless trade agreement with the UK . this be pure fiction - and daft . last year Canada achieve what Barnier be deny be possible for the British . to top it all , the EU last week agree frictionless border with Japan .

May wo n't really be in charge until she win election the time have come for Theresa May to call a General Election and bury all the whine , cheating , antidemocratic , Brexitdenying pussy that would love to thwart the will of 17.4million British people and keep us in the European Union . call a General Election now , Prime Minister , and bury for all time the referendum denier in your own party . call a General Election and bury Nick Clegg , Ed Miliband , Peter Mandelson , Nicola Sturgeon , Keir Starmer and the rest . call an election and confront all the mealy mouth hypocrite who would deny our democracy . bury the lot of them , Prime Minister . repeal Clegg ' S Fixed-Term Parliaments Act of @card@ , which mean the next General Election be not until @card@ , and call an election today . be there an appetite for a General Election ? not really . after that long , bruise - and totally decisive - referendum campaign , it feel like the British people crave a period of stability and calm while we set about make Brexit work . many insist the Prime Minister should simply ignore the delusion of the anti- Brexit crew . but increasingly it feel like Theresa May have no option but to go to the country . the time be now . May be a hugely popular Prime Minister who have a majority of just @card@ . it be not enough for the battle ahead . there could hardly be a good time for an election . every other party be in disarray . the work class will never vote Labour again . the Lib Dems have be annihilate by Nick Clegg and Ukip be a brawl , bitch shamble without Nigel Farage . and north of the border - contrary to Nicola Sturgeon ' s virulent anti-Brexit rhetoric - the SNP be by far the most Eurosceptic party in Scotland , with @card@ per cent of their own voter back Brexit . there will never be a good time than Right NOW for Theresa May to get the mandate she so desperately need . a General Election now would give the Prime Minister the thumping majority she will need to deliver the clean break from the EU the British people so clearly want - and vote for in great number than we ever vote for anything in our history . but without an election , and with a majority of just @card@ , I have my doubt that may - for all her popularity across the country - can even get her grammar school legislation through Parliament . and if she ca n't deliver grammar school , then how will she deliver the sovereign nation we want to be ? Brexit-denying rabble do not support EU referendum Those who would love to keep this country under the cloven hoof of Brussels be not real democrat . there be not one of that Brexit-denying rabble that support a referendum on the EU . how can sore loser like Tony Blair , Clegg and Miliband bleat about democracy now ? they do n't want democracy . they do n't want real debate . they just want to keep us inside the corrupt , job-destroying , anti-democratic , fail EU , by fair mean or foul . they would , I have no doubt , all gleefully see a General Election as a last chance to wipe out the decision we make on June @card@ . yet the case for call a General Election now seem overwhelming . May ' s majority of @card@ will simply not be enough . so have the courage to call an election now , Theresa . and I would bet my last euro you will win it by a landslide .
enjoy applause now , Theresa , it ' ll get hard Theresa May be the Tories ' Harry Kane . like the Spurs striker , below leave , she be one of their own . she join the party as a teenager , meet her husband at a Tory disco and still go out leafletting on the weekend . she be also much closer to the activist in age than Cameron be : he be @card@ when he become leader , she be @card@ today . all this help explain the rapturous reception she will get when she take to the stage tomorrow to address the conference for the first time as leader . but Mrs May should enjoy the applause , because her job be about to get a lot harder . she be take the unusual step of speak on the opening day of conference because she want to get Brexit out of the way as soon as she can . number @card@ hope this will clear the deck for talk about domestic policy for the rest of the week . in her main address on Wednesday , Mrs May plan to focus on how she want a , ` ` Better deal for ordinary working people ' ' . but those hope for specific on Brexit be go to be disappoint . one Downing Street source tell me Mrs May ' S speech will be about ` ` show momentum ' ' , emphasise how she have be engage with business and foreign leader . number @card@ say Mrs May will not set a date for invoke Article @card@ , the two-year process for leave the EU , tomorrow . her Cabinet ally be dismissive of those push for a timetable on this . ` ` it be not grip the country . but it be grip minister who feel the need to say something quotable , ' ' one tell me . I understand that when the Brexit Cabinet Committee last meet a couple of week ago , minister be still give their view on what to do , rather than try to settle the government ' s negotiate position . Mrs May close the meeting , with the message : ` ` no run commentary please . ' ' ` ` have tell everyone else not to provide a run commentary , she ca n't do so herself , ' ' say one committee member . but diplomatic negotiation ca n't be conduct entirely in secret these day . not least because some on the other side of this negotiation be keen to put the bad possible spin on Britain ' s position as they try to poach business from this country . industry and the City also need to know , at least , what the British government be try to achieve . without that , they warn , they be simply go to have to assume the worst-case scenario . the Brexit minster have try to give more definition to what Brexit mean . but their attempt have be slap down by Number @card@ . this have cause some unhappiness . ` ` we be be do for state the bleed obvious , ' ' one of them have be hear to protest . part of the problem , as one Cabinet minister explain , be that Number @card@ be , ` ` still work out who it can trust ' ' . but Mrs May need to sort this pronto . for there be an increase view among minister that ` ` Brexit mean Brexit ' ' ca n't hold as a line for that much long , and certainly not past the New year . Mrs May want the conference message to be that her government will deliver ` ` a good deal for ordinary working people , and a good deal for Britain abroad ' ' . but she need to start show voter how she be go to do that .

why UK need a sharp Brexit ; Tory ' LEAVE ' Advocate ON DITCHING EU let us be clear . the EU referendum be the big vote in the democratic history of our country and it deliver a clear result - a majority of well over a million in favour of Britain leave the EU . since take office the Prime Minister , Theresa May , inset below , have be admirably clear , too , that Brexit have to mean Brexit . almost everybody in the House of Commons accept that the people ' S decision be final . so what be we wait for ? article @card@ of the Lisbon Treaty can and should be trigger within week . within the same time frame , Britain should start negotiation for access to the single market - and strike our own trade deal with country outside the EU . it be already apparent that a lot of the dire consequence of a vote to leave that be put forward by the Remain campaign as part of Project Fear have prove unfounded . Britain ' s economic strength remain unaffected . consumer confidence be high and key indicator have not plunge in the way we be tell would happen . nevertheless , what do risk cause damage , for as long as it continue , be uncertainty . business face decision about expansion and growth and investor want to put money into this country need to have a good idea of what the arrangement be go to be with Europe and the rest of the world once Britain leave the EU . it will take time to agree but the sooner we start , the sooner uncertainty will be remove . trigger Article @card@ be the beginning of the process , not the end . it be the start gun and fire it will signal that serious negotiation be under way . there be bound to be a lengthy period to carry out those negotiation but as long as we delay their start there will be some people who will suggest there can be a fudge , second thought or further obstacle place in the way . as the Prime Minister have make clear that be not the case and we be go to leave , the sooner we fire the gun the well . nobody have give any good reason for delay . our aim be clear . we want to maintain access to the single market and to trade freely with Europe just as they will still want to trade freely with us . however , this will be subject to negotiation and we must set three key condition . first , we have get to regain control of our border and our immigration policy . we can choose who should have the right to enter and to work here . but I would like to see any such policy apply equally to everybody and on the basis of who will make a contribution to our society - not accord to whether or not they happen to be a national of an EU member state . and we must be able to set a control on overall number and deliver on our promise to reduce the net figure to ten of thousand . second , as long as we delay we continue to give huge sum to the EU every month as our membership fee - money which could be well spend in this country . as soon as we can conclude these negotiation , we will have the dividend of that money to spend on our priority . third , we need to free company that do not trade with the EU as quickly as possible from have to comply with European regulation . it be a simple measure to amend our own law so that all existing EU regulation continue to apply . once that be do , we can then go through them , department by department , to decide which be sensible and we want to keep , and which we want to get rid of - those that simply add cost without deliver any benefit , and there will be quite a lot of those . this do not require negotiation . once we be no long member of the EU , it will be a matter solely for the British government to decide . of course , Europe will still be a major trading partner . but the great opportunity lie in our relationship with the fastest-growing economy outside of the EU . at the moment we be hold back from develop trade and investment deal with those country because , while we be in the EU , they have to be agree across all @card@ country . that be why it have prove impossible so far for Europe to make deal with China , India or the USA . outside of the EU , we can get on with negotiation for bilateral deal which will be much easy and quick to achieve . we can also ensure they cover area in which Britain be strong , such as financial service and creative industry . already , a number of country have indicate they be keen to reach agreement . before we can begin to do any of this we need to get the formal process under way , and that mean trigger Article @card@ . I do n't say that it have to happen tomorrow , but I see no advantage in delay . we need to get on with it now so that all those who wish to invest in this country , to trade with us or to come and work here , know how they stand . my blueprint for QUITTING TRIGGER Article @card@ of the Treaty of Lisbon . 1 that give us the right to quit unilaterally and give us two year to negotiate an exit deal to be approve by a ` ` qualified majority ' ' of EU member state and subject to a possible veto by the European Parliament . @card@ Start negotiation for access to the single market . @card@ Regain control of our border and immigration policy . negotiate visa arrangement that suit us . @card@ stop pay into the EU budget as soon as possible . @card@ Transfer EU regulation into British law then decide which we want to keep and which one we wish to repeal . @card@ Begin negotiation of bilateral trade deal with country outside the EU .

Mrs May be make her speech buoy by an endorsement from Donald Trump , but be there really any reason for encouragement ? at the same time as the US presidentelect be suggest a UK trade deal , he threaten European car manufacturer with a massive import tariff on every vehicle . why on earth would he impose punitive tax like that on German vehicle and not on British vehicle ? last year a record number of Britishmade car go for export - more than 1.2million vehicle , make up more than three-quarter of all motor produce here . more than half of those go to the EU and half the remain car be ship to the US . madness but we ' re suppose to believe that Donald Trump will let these UK motor roll in at the expense of BMW , Audi and Porsche . in a few day Mr Trump will be invest with enormous power . even without the authority of Congress , he can legally impose tariff of up to @card@ per cent for @card@ day . he have say nothing to suggest that he want to make export to America easier than it be now . instead he have threaten to get tough with China , withdraw from talk on the 12-nation Trans-Pacific Partnership and renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement - or scrap it entirely . three year of talk between the EU and US over the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership have now be bin . and now Mr Trump be threaten EU exporter with massive trade barrier . it ' s madness to think Europe would not hit back in a trade war which could quickly cripple the world economy - and that include Britain . Donald Trump can no longer be ignore , but he ca n't be rely upon . instead we need a dose of reality from our political leader north and south of the border . it ' s time for some simple , clear fact and figure or perhaps just the stark admission that nobody have a clue what be go on .

Nicola ' S OUR Ace in BREXIT SHUFFLE I WAS delight to see Nicola Sturgeon , the First Minister of Scotland , address the Seanad yesterday . in my opinion she be one of the most skilled politician in Europe at the moment , and an important ally for Ireland in the forthcoming Brexit negotiation . I work a bit with her when I be European Affairs Minister . as the Scottish Deputy First Minister at the time , she be responsible for EU Affairs within the devolve Scottish government and so we meet several time . during that period the Scottish independence referendum be take place , and Nicola , above , play an important role in that campaign . she prove herself to be an effective and impressive political operator and medium performer . while the referendum be lose , Nicola ' S star rise and she replace Alex Salmond as the leader of the Scottish National Party and the country ' S First Minister . since then the SNP have sweep the deck in the Westminster election , and Nicola have become a more prominent political figure in the UK than ever before . with Brexit now on the way , she will also become a much more important figure on the European scene . her threat to hold another independence referendum be real . it have the potential to really upset the planned Brexit and internal UK politics . and if she go ahead with the vote I believe she will win . I also believe that if Scotland secure independence , they will be welcome into the European Union . Ireland should take a very clear position on this . there be a long way to go in this Brexit process , and Scotland would be a key ally around the EU decision-making table . a lot of people believe the threat of another referendum be just bluff . know Nicola Sturgeon though , I be certain that she be a woman of great determination . I would not bet on her blink first . British Prime Minister Theresa May have more than meet her match .

can David fill in the blank ? you may have notice there have be a bit of a row at Westminster over @card@ report which the UK Government have carry out on the impact of Brexit . pay attention at the back , this be go to get complicated . in December last year , Brexit Secretary David Davis tell MP that his official be busily prepare ` ` about @card@ set of analysis ' ' on the impact of Brexit . in a BBC interview last June he say : ` ` we ' ve get @card@ , nearly @card@ sectoral analysis already do . ' ' in front of MP again in October he say the report offer ` ` excruciating detail ' ' . in fact , they be so detailed that the Prime Minister have n't quite manage to read her way through them all . then , a month ago , MP vote to have the report hand over to the Brexit Committee . it be a unanimous vote and the entire Tory Party stay away in the hope that , by ignore the decision , it might just go away . the Speaker have other view , however . he rule the vote be valid and the government have well cough up . but then a very strange thing happen .

we get ta open up about our Brex life regular reader of this column - both of you - will recall that I recently point out how the UK Government be refuse to confirm or deny whether it have do any work in how Brexit will impact the Scottish economy . minister reckon that reveal the awful truth about whether or not they have do any calculation could have a terrible impact on Brexit talk . that ' S because , if we have n't do the work , EU negotiator might laugh at them and call them name . whereas , if they have do the work , EU negotiator might laugh at them , call them name and say , ` ` Tellt you ! ' ' . now the Department for Food and Rural Affairs have join in too . jam their finger in their ear and shout ` ` la la la , we ' re not listen ' ' Defra have turn down a Brexit-themed freedom of information request from Unite the Union . the reason they have turn it down be that answer the question be ` ` not in the public interest ' ' . and the top secret thing that Unite want to know be how much Defra have estimate your shopping bill might increase in the five year after Brexit . but the government say it ' s not in the public interest - not in YOUR interest - to know that kind of stuff . why worry your pretty little head about it ? there ' s no point cry over spill milk . what ' S do be do . well just to keep on go to the shop - for as long as you can still afford to . why do this stuff matter ? well , apart from the obvious , this week see another round of EU-UK Brexit talk and it would be fair to say that the EU ' s chief negotiator be only slightly more lukewarm this time than he be a month ago . follow the soft tone of Mrs May ' s Florence speech , Michel Barnier say : ` ` we ' ve have a constructive week - yes - but we be not yet there in term of achieve sufficient progress . further work be need . ' ' that ' s crucial . if the EU decide - and they be the only one who can decide - that there be not yet ` ` sufficient progress ' ' on the big issue of right of EU citizen , outstanding payment and the Irish Border , there will be no trade talk . that mean they wo n't even start to talk about a trade deal until there be ` ` sufficient progress ' ' . and the announcement of M. Barnier ' S decision will probably come on the same day that Mrs May make her big speech to the Tory conference so it should be interesting . trade deal count . remember how we be tell that we be about to scoosh the bestest , lovely easy trade deal in the whole world ever with America ? it be about the time that Mrs May go trip hand in hand down the stair with Donald Trump . ` ` Trade deal will open door to US job ' ' the headline say . anyway , we get an insight into how that ' S go this week when the United States slap a @card@ per cent import tax on plane build in Northern Ireland . this week ' S headline say ` ` May threaten trade war with US ' ' . the PM say she be ` ` disappointed ' ' about the squabble but not quite as disappoint as the thousand of worker whose job be now on the line . in the past the EU would probably have come out to fight for the UK - maybe hit back with some import tax of their own . now , not so much . just give me cake Barnier ! you need to be more generous Theresa

' ' what she mean : Britain ' S parliament will be sovereign now and judge at the European Court of Justice will not be able to make law by the backdoor too - the buck will stop with Britain after Brexit . 2 . Brexit must ` ` strengthen the precious union between the four nation of the United Kingdom ' ' . what she mean : she be try very hard to reassure the people of Scotland and Northern Ireland - area of the UK where the majority do not vote leave . she hint that the devolve parliament could get more power when they ` ` be return to Westminster from Brussels ' ' in a bid to see off Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon from demand another referendum on Scottish Independence . whe ot min Nico anot Inde cont com @card@ . Brexit mean we must ` ` get control of the number of people come to Britain from the EU ' ' . what she mean : the government will probably set a cap on the number of low-skilled migrant come from the EU after we have leave . but she clearly do not rule out keep some unskilled EU migration in the public sector and if boss need it - sign that she may base the system around job offer . 4 . ` ` not only will the government protect the right of worker out in European legislation , we build on them . ' ' what she mean : the PM move to shoot Labour ' S fox here - as the opposition claim Brexit will lead to a watering wa down of right for worker such as Health and Safety legislation secure at a European level . 5 . ` ` we will pursue a bold and ambitious Free Trade Agreement with the EU . ' ' what she mean : we be quit the EU Single Market which insist on free trade in good , service , capital and people but she still want tariff-free trade to be ` ` as frictionless as possible ' ' . Britain would be prepare to pay for trade access , but could no longer ` ` contribute vast sum to the EU budget ' ' . we be also quit the Customs Union which erect common tariff against the rest of the world - because it would stop us strike our own free trade deal . @card@ . ` ` all of us in Europe face the challenge of cross-border crime and a deadly terrorist threat . ' ' what she mean : Britain lead the world on intelligence and security matter and the former Home Secretary know other EU country will want us to continue share our knowledge - an ace in her renegotiate pack . @card@ . we will not find ` ` ourselves stick forever in some kind of permanent political purgatory ' ' . what she mean : PM say she be happy to have a phase introduction of a new deal so there be no cliff edge - but we will walk away if there be no deal .
Brexit Britain need hero ... unleash Boris Theresa May like to hedge her bet until she know for sure which horse to back . but by seek and win the job as our post-Brexit PM , she have not just pick the favourite - she be in the saddle and gallop at full speed . the question for the country she now lead be whether she be relish the ride of her life or cling on like grim death .

Chancellor Merkel be terrify of be leave alone with France and the other without our Â£14billion a year to keep them afloat . all the angry word and threat from Brussel be ... just word . ghostly has-been such as Tony Blair and John Major make total clot of themselves by denounce the ` ` tyranny of the majority ' ' and call for another referendum . with Project Fear eclipse by so much economic sunshine , the Brexit majority would turn into a landslide . yet , thanks to the BBC , the Moaning Minnies who refuse to accept the June @card@ verdict be fill the government ' s silence with black propaganda . worried voter need to see and hear Theresa May and her Brexit minister out there on the front foot , speak up enthusiastically about Britain ' s prospect of freedom and prosperity . why do n't Theresa give Blair and Major a piece of her mind ? and all those useless EU leader who have get it so wrong on so much ? she ' S quite capable of it . there be a strong , confident story to tell . it need to be tell with clarity and conviction , not timorous caution . we put Theresa May on the Couch - Pages @card@ & @card@ ' LOONY lefty include Jeremy Corbyn , Red Ken Livingstone and Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell fawn over dead Cuban dictator Fidel Castro . ` ` for all his flaw , ' ' opine Corbyn , ` ` Castro be a huge figure of modern history .

Scots Secretary David Mundell then set out a plan make it impossible to go to the poll until after the next Holyrood election in four year . as the row escalate yesterday , Mr Mundell and Scots Conservative boss Ruth Davidson refuse to say when - or if - a new independence vote will be sanction by Westminster . Ms Davidson say : ` ` we be not set timetable . we be not pin this to year . ` ` I believe it be only right that people have the opportunity to examine the UK ' s new relationship with the European union once it be up and run . people should only be ask to make a judgment about whether to leave or remain within a 300-year-old union of nation when they have see for themselves how that Union be function , follow Brexit . ` ` they should also know what the alternative entail , and we have see no clarity from the SNP on even the basic question of their proposition .

' ' when Mrs May fire the start gun on Brexit at the end of this month it begin a process which , accord to EU treaty , must be complete by March @card@ . but Mr Mundell say there may be ` ` transitional arrangement ' ' which would push a poll further into the future . he say : ` ` we do not believe the Brexit process would be conclude by that point . ` ` you ca n't offer the people of Scotland a fair , informed choice about the alternative without know what the Brexit process have deliver . ` ` it would be completely inappropriate to set date but , if there be ever to be a referendum , it have to be on the basis that there be a fair choice by which people understand the option . ' ' Ms Sturgeon planned Indy-Ref2 for autumn @card@ or spring @card@ - when ` ` the UK leave the EU ... or at least within a short time after it ' ' . she announce the plan on Monday as it will take around @card@ month to get the legislation for a referendum vote in place . the campaign itself will stretch the date to approximately two year from now . but the Tory plan - which kick in some time after Britain leave the EU in @card@ - will push any possibility of a referendum back to Spring @card@ - the schedule date for the next Holyrood election . Ms Sturgeon ' S spokesman add that the SNP mandate for a referendum would run out at the next election . he say : ` ` the mandate be clear - the mandate be for the parliamentary term . ` ` the First Minister have make clear her preferred timescale and that be the timescale we ' re work to . ` ` that be the basis on which this government be elect and the manifesto cover the parliamentary term . ' ' but Labour leader Kezia Dugdale back the Tory block and say : ` ` there should not be another referendum until after Brexit . ` ` we have no idea what Brexit look like , or how it will impact on Scotland . ` ` people can not be ask to make a decision about the future of our 300-year-old union in the dark . ` ` if there be to be another vote , the people of Scotland deserve clarity on what they be be ask to vote on . ' ' ' Biggest recruiting sergeant for indy ' but in a stinging rebuke , Ms Sturgeon say : ` ` when people have a choice to say what kind of future they want , I will be argue for this country to be in charge of its own finance and of build a fair society and a strong economy . ` ` Kezia Dugdale will be on the side of Ruth Davidson and Theresa May yet again , and her party will continue to die as a result . ' ' Mrs May ignite the row yesterday by say ` ` now be not the time ' ' for a referendum as the UK will be mire in Brexit negotiation . she say : ` ` we should be work together to get that right deal for Scotland and the UK . ` ` that ' s my job as PM , so for that reason I say to the SNP : now be not the time . ' ' the First Minister initially respond to the referendum block on Twitter , say : ` ` the Scottish government be not propose a referendum now ... but when Brexit term be clear and before an alternative path be too late . ' ' she say a section @card@ order need to approve a poll must be discuss with the government now to nail the timescale . and she warn : ` ` if the Tories refuse to do so , they would effectively be block Scotland ' s right to choose when the Brexit term clear . ` ` this would be undemocratic and proof positive they fear the verdict of the Scottish people . ' ' in the Commons , the SNP ' S Pete Wishart tell MP any attempt to block a referendum would backfire . he say : ` ` surely there be no case for stand in the way of democracy and defy the will of Scotland ' s elected parliament . ` ` if this government be think of stand in the way of Scottish democracy , it will be the big recruiting sergeant possible for independence .

how Osborne get his Europe figure so totally tangle ; Economist RUBBISHES Â£4,300 Claim WRONG and mislead . that be the good way to describe the most quote figure of the referendum campaign . in April the Chancellor say family would be Â£4,300 a year worse off with Brexit . he also describe this as a fact . it be nothing of the sort . unfortunately the Prime Minister keep repeat this number . the figure be produce by the Treasury - the Whitehall department that serve Chancellor George Osborne and oversee the economy . let me explain six reason why this Â£4,300 figure be not worth the paper it be write on . flaky FORECASTS First , as part of its long-term forecast of Brexit , the treasury predict what the economy would look like in @card@ . there be no harm in longterm forecast but it be not possible to be precise about what will happen in @card@ year ' time . to put this in perspective , back in March the Chancellor have to announce revision in his Budget forecast for this year that have be make only four month earlier . growth IGNORED Second , Osborne say that people would lose money with Brexit . but that be not what even his own figure show . the Treasury expect the economy to be much big in @card@ than now , whether we stay in the EU or leave . but they do n't report it this way . instead they say the economy would be @card@ per cent small with Brexit than if we remain in . even so , that would still leave the UK economy almost @card@ per cent large with Brexit by @card@ than it be now . hardly a loss . cherry Picking Third , the Treasury ' s growth forecast for Brexit be base upon pessimistic assumption about future policy . in particular , they assume that if we be to leave the EU we would not change either our migration or regulation policy . as both of these be key issue in the Brexit campaign , you would think both be likely to change . likewise , the Treasury make cautious assumption about our likely trade policy after Brexit . more realistic assumption would result in much strong growth with Brexit . fiddle Figures fourth , the next thing the Chancellor do be to report the number in an unusual way . this have already be question by many , include the cross-party house of Commons Treasury Select Committee . gross domestic product ( GDP ) measure the size of an economy . this include lot of firm as well as many people . so if you divide the size of an economy only by the number of people , you get a misleadingly large figure . this be what they do , calculate GDP per head . you do n't need to be an economist to smell a rat by now . economist look at income per household , a much small number . indeed , the Treasury Select Committee say this change alone would mean that the Â£4,300 figure of GDP per household be equivalent to Â£1,600 in median household disposable income . far small . hike the Numbers Fifth , instead of look at this in term of what it mean for individual , they look at household . the aim be probably to make the cost seem as big as possible in the way it be report . a household be not the same as a family . it be the number of people who live in the same dwelling . the average household be @card@ people in the UK . so immediately by look at household it make the number @card@ time big than look at individual . GDP of Â£4,300 per household be the same as Â£1,800 GDP per person . it would be far small in term of average disposable income . dodgy Division Sixth , to get the cost per household in @card@ you should divide by the much large number of the million more household who will be live here then . instead , the Treasury use the number of household today . this make the final figure of cost per household higher . it be n't only the number . the Chancellor ' S report do n't provide a fair assessment of the risk or opportunity . remain in the EU contain huge uncertainty but this go largely unmentioned . the EU be expect to be the slow-growth region of the world economy . at its core be the unstable euro . and even though we be not in the eurozone we would find it hard not to be drag into the problem face the EU . these include the crisis in Greece , the unfunded liability of Germany ' s pension system and the problem of Italian bank , plus the obscenely high rate of youth unemployment . leave , naturally , present its own www.problems.No one should kid themselves it will be completely plain sailing . I have look at this in detail and conclude that despite near-term challenge , Brexit be the good option on offer . so what be forecast as a Â£4,300 loss per household by the Chancellor really should have be report as a longterm gain for each of us .

a SINN-ISTER DEMAND Sinn Fein be to blame for a major new Brexit stand-off over the Northern Ireland border , minister claim . they say the IRA ' s political wing have push Irish premier Leo Varadkar into a new hardline demand which could sink the whole Brexit deal . he now insist that to keep an open border Ulster must stay in the EU single market and custom union if the rest of Britain leave . minister say this come after heavy political pressure from Gerry Adams of Sinn Fein , whose party be set for big election gain if Mr Varadkar ' s weak fine Gael government collapse soon . the plan be at once shoot down as ` ` impossible ' ' by Brexit Secretary David Davis yesterday , who insist protect the two EU institution ` ` can not come at cost to the constitutional and economic integrity of the United Kingdom ' ' . he say : ` ` this can not amount to create a new border inside our United Kingdom . ' ' Ex-Cabinet minister John Whittingdale say : ` ` Sinn Fein should not be try to profit from make a Brexit deal very hard to reach .

PM Ruth Can UNITE All of US Just when we need a strong Prime Minister , Theresa May be reveal as have kitten heel of clay . full credit to May for remain at her station - rather like Captain Edward Smith of the Titanic , and completely unlike David Cameron , who immediately run away when it all go wrong for him . but thought inevitably turn to who will replace May . and the obvious choice be not necessarily the right answer . I love old Boris . but perhaps the country - all those youngster who just vote for the first time , the Ukip voter who be change allegiance , the working-class Labour voter who despise Corbyn - have have enough Old Etonians as PM to last them a lifetime . how about Ruth Davidson , above , who humble the SNP in Scotland and secure our United Kingdom for a generation ? it be true that Ruth be not dream of a hard Brexit . but then if this country crave a hard Brexit , it should have give Theresa May her landslide . this be not a bad time to recall that while the 17.4million of us who vote to leave be the big vote in British history , the 16million who vote to stay be the second big vote in British history . nothing can stop Brexit happen . but we now need a Brexit that do its good to unite us all . and a PM capable of the job . Ruth Davidson - who once describe herself as a ` ` shovelfaced lesbian ' ' - be tough , funny and ferociously smart . and what a great country this would be if the Prime Minister stand wave on the doorstep of No10 with her wife standing by her side . now that ' s what I call progressive .

Brexit bridge Yesterday ' S remark on Brexit by Leo Varadkar do not please some in Britain , but the Taoiseach be merely stick to longstanding Irish policy on the issue . like it or not , the UK be go to leave the EU . how that happen will ensure citizen here on both side of the Border can get on with their life with as little disruption as possible . despite some DUP suggestion , if we have a hard Brexit all the ' technology ' in the world will not prevent border control . and such control will hurt business on both side of the Border . it be in everyone ' S interest , include ours , that a deal be work out to prevent a return to the old day of custom post . unfortunately , ongoing negotiation between the UK and the EU be not promising . both side , particularly the European , seem intent on play hardball and - @card@ month from the deadline - very little progress have be make . the Taoiseach warn that ` ` time be run out ' ' and ` ` unique solution ' ' be require to deal with the unprecedented diplomatic and economic challenge pose by Brexit . both be statement of the bleed obvious , but both be worth repeat . if @card@ year of the Troubles can be solve with negotiation , then certainly Brexit can be successfully achieve too .

EU need a Brit of tough love ; Ireland ' S BREXIT Fear it ' S see be many observer as the great potential threat to Ireland ' s economic stability . with debate around Brexit continue to rage ahead of Britain ' s referendum on June @card@ , the impact on the Emerald Isle be unclear at good . but it may not be all doom and gloom - as some have predict - and could actually have a positive impact on EU policy , explain Vincent Mccarthy , Head of Investment Consulting at Invesco Ltd. WITH the risk of Brexit loom large , the big question be : can Britain break European heart and still stay friend ? and more importantly , can Europe stay strong after the hole leave by the loss of their long-term partner ? how the relationship end will determine the impact of Brexit . a lot have be write on the potential fallout from Brexit . the UK Treasury devote @card@ page to it last week , in support of stay in , estimate leave the EU could cost each British household Â£4,300 ( ( Euro ) @card@ ) per year . this be a figure derive from their forecast of a six per cent drop in Britain ' s gross domestic product by @card@ - a measure of economic output divide by the current 27million British household . the report be great news for those in favour of remain in the EU and a blow to the likes of Tory Mayor of London Boris Johnson , above , who be campaign for Brexit . as with all economics , there be huge uncertainty in term of estimate the fallout from a British vote to exit the EU . while both the Yes and the No side will argue their case for In and Out , respectively , the reality be the long-term fallout will depend heavily on just how the relationship end . IMF Director Christine Lagarde recently say : ` ` it ' s my personal hope it do n't break . like all marriage , good talk can actually help and I hope the dialogue can continue . ' ' still , just because it could be a messy divorce be not reason enough for Britain to stay in an EU clearly at a crossroad . rather than lambast Britain for consider their future in Europe , other member , on a path to close integration with their eye close , should take this time to consider what they want from this relationship . too many relationship , in all walk of life , be define by ' it ' S easier to stay ' . leaving require a leap of faith . a fear of the unknown be why people stay in a job they dislike , or stay in a bad relationship , or rarely move outside their comfort zone . it be why I believe Briton will vote to remain in the EU , the same reason that have me convince Scottish independence would not happen . nevertheless , it be a risk that Irel tion Ireland can not ignore . there be many facet to our relationship with Britain , but from an economic perspective , there would be significant implication for the Irish economy . indigenous industry , more reliant on the British market than multinational , would be hurt most by the uncertainty emanate from a breakup . wou tion in relia than hur ema however , rather than bemoan the risk of Brexit , company should address it head on by seek out new market . shou seek Fo rem regi for example , Latin America remain a relatively untapped region for Irish company , a develop region with a population of over @card@ million . the Brexit risk be a reminder for Irish firm to keep widen trade link worldwide . ultimately , I believe a fear of the unknown will sway voter ' mind and Britain will remain . EU country now need to come up with a good prenuptial agreement - as it ' s the uncertainty around the term of a future breakup which could cause the big risk . event since the financial crisis show how Europe ' S institution like to play the fear card if you refuse to comply . Greece be bully into stay - but be they any good off now ? no relationship can survive long-term where control be the power that unite . l FOLLOW Vincent McCarthy on Twitter at @ askthevmanorsubscribetohispersonalblogmacromarkets.ie .

Gibraltar uncertainty the British territory ' S future be throw into doubt when the EU say the Brexit deal will not apply there unless Spain give the nod . it effectively mean the Spanish could use Brexit to seek joint sovereignty , boot out the Navy or block any transport there . but he also say establish the future of the UK ' s military base in Cyprus should not be difficult . and he say the EU want to avoid a ` ` hard border ' ' in www.Ireland.NO ' Individual ' Economic DEALS DEALS for specific sector of the British economy under Brexit be rule out , suggest no special protection for the City of London . but the EU also know strong and constructive tie be in the interest of both party . it also back call for an early deal to guarantee the right of citizen live and work abroad . EU SETS THE rule Britain be tell it must abide by the EU ' s rule at least until Brexit Day in March @card@ . that mean no trade talk with non-EU nation until then , unless do through the union . and all communication must be through all @card@ remain state - with no try to pick off country for separate negotiation . the Sun say - Page ten

the Sun SAYS Blows to Brexit Bitter Remainers must not be allow to tie Theresa May ' s hand before her negotiation with Brussels begin . they will be damage our interest and slapping voter in the face . yet those such as Tony Blair , Peter Mandelson , the self-appointed Brexit blocker Gina Miller and some in the Commons and Lords be still fight the war they lose last June @card@ . unelected peer inflict the first blow on Wednesday , insist Mrs May must secure the right of EU citizen here regardless of whether Brussel as generous to our expats . next week they be expect to back Parliament have a veto over the final Brexit deal in a new act of Parliament . MP Must reject both amendment . the Article @card@ Bill solely enact the simple answer to a simple question : should we remain in the EU , or leave ? Britain ' s answer be leave . not ` ` leave , but only if all EU migrant be look after , even if our expats be n't ' ' . nor ` ` leave , so long as MP on the lose side can scupper the final deal ' ' .

lWITH the current political mood [ ... ] lWITH the current political mood across the UK at a low follow Brexit and the ongoing fallout from Donald Trump ' s victory in the American presidential race , I be amaze to see the SNP get their knickers in a twist over a more bizarre subject . SNP MSP Colin Beattie , right , who represent Midlothian North and Musselburgh , call on the UK Government to challenge the new design of Toblerone chocolate bar , cite in a Holyrood motion that its change of shape be ` ` emblematic ' ' of the devastating consequence of Brexit . while a plunge in the value of the pound follow the Brexit vote have worry many and real concern have be air on what our future trade relationship with the EU and other economy may be , Mr Beattie seem to have focus instead on the large gap between chocolate triangle . you have to ask yourself whether the people Mr Beattie serve feel that investigate Toblerone be an efficient use of his resource . I ' m certain there be much more pertinent issue in Midlothian North and Musselburgh include barrier to access health service and transport . it leave an unsavoury taste , unlike the pyramid-shaped chocolate . his motion call on the Scottish Parliament to offer its official condolence to those ` ` mourn ' ' the change to the classic confectionery . perhaps instead we should be mourn those in a position of power have finally lose the plot .
BREX OFFENDERS ; Fury at House of Lords plot to keep us in EU UNELECTED peer be slap down by Theresa May yesterday for threaten to block Brexit . a House of Lords plot to try to force a second referendum have be reveal . but the PM ' s official spokesman say peer should instead ` ` focus on get behind ' ' Brexit . baroness Patience Wheatcroft say there be dozen of peer who want to stop or delay the official trigger to leave the EU . in an interview she say it be ` ` imperative that we do n't press the button on Article @card@ ' ' . the Tory peer say she hope delay in the Lords of any potential Brexit law would lead to a second vote . a legal challenge on whether the government can trigger Article @card@ without the prior authorisation of Parliament be set to be hear in the High Court in the autumn . baroness Wheatcroft say : ` ` if it come to a bill , I think the Lords might actually delay thing .

should Brits be brick it over Brexit ? ; How EU Vote COULD AFFECT Property MARKET your place WE may be face a sizzling summer but the hot topic of to day have to be Brexit . with the referendum loom , and scaremongering rife , would-be property purchaser might be forgive for sit on the garden fence . but what will happen to the property market after June @card@ ? how will our vote , in or out , impact on the affordability of home and their value ? even before we get to the vote , there be sign that the uncertainty surround the result could be have an effect on the investor market , which ultimate ly filter down to the rest of us . in London especially , jittery overseas investor be stay away , with some even abandon property they have already reserve with a deposit . UK-based private investor have also slow down their activity . so demand be soften , which mean price could too . but what be the overall implication for the rest of us ? here be my Brexit FAQs : what will happen to mortgage rate after the vote ? if we choose Brexit , as Boris Johnson and Co propose , the political uncertainty that will follow will put the UK economy under pressure , and as such , it will be hard to see how the Bank of England would be able to increase interest rate s. on the other hand , stay in Europe - as PM David Cameron want us to - when the rest of the Eurozone be still struggle with lukewarm economic performance be not an environment in which interest rate be likely to be raise any time soon . so my money be on low interest rate for the foreseeable future . what will happen to property pr ice in the UK ? a vote for Brexit be likely to lead to a short-term negative impact on the City of London . as a result , London property price could get hit hard , which would have a ripple effect on the rest of the UK housing market . however that would increase affordability , so one result might be that firsttime buyer be able to climb on to the property ladder in location that be financially out of their reach previously . David Catt , of property market analyst Hometrack , say : ` ` if the UK leave the EU , it would create a prolonge d period of uncertainty , lead to reduce demand , which , consider the tight supply of housing in the UK , could feed quickly into house price and result in a major slowdown in the rate of growth . ' ' not necessarily a bad thing . what about the availability of housing ? potentially , a Brexit vote threaten the City ' s shortterm stability , and therefore also the availability of fund for further home-building . another risk be that if property price fall , developer will not want to build home in a market of downward price . the only way to mitigate this would be government-sponsored affordable mortgage . interestingly , in the run-up to the referendum the construction sector have slow to its low level for almost three year . many firm clearly seem unwilling to commit to new project in the short term , and builder be ta king on subcontractor rather than hire staff while they wait to see what happen . the drop in home-building will mean more people chase limited stock , which could push price back up . what will happen to property purchasing cost ? this have very little to do with the vote . cost be very much a government decision , and give the state of the economy , I predict that if the government can , it will try to find a way to increase tax and raise revenue . in a nutshell , while the referendum be be play out , and there be a lull in property activity underpinne d by uncertainty , the opportunist among you might be in luck . with the low mortgage rate on record , now might be a unique chance to nip in there , negotiate a good price and grab the deal of a lifetime .

fatal L FLAWS ; NEW BREXIT FURORE AFTER Queen ' S SPEECH ; lHolyrood ' veto ' over repeal bill ; lConsent snub could spark chaos MSPs could have a veto over whether crucial Brexit law unveil in Theresa May ' s Queen ' s Speech impact on Scotland , it emerge yesterday . the Prime Minister admit her flagship great repeal bill - design to copy EU law onto the UK statute book - may need Holyrood ' s consent to alter swathe of Scots law . the revelation raise the prospect of a constitutional stand-off when the crisis-hit Tory try to pass their Brexit law at Westminster . Mrs May be force to admit a ` ` legislative consent motion ' ' might need to be pass by Holyrood after the Queen ' S Speech formally unveil the humble PM ' s scaledback plan for government . expert last night say MSPs refuse to pass the motion would n't allow them to derail the entire Brexit legislation . but a snub could trigger chaos by stop the repeal bill apply to law here . the revelation come as Mrs May row back on a series of controversial manifesto pledge in the wake of her election humiliation . the PM climb down on end the pension triple lock , and backtrack on English policy such as expand grammar school , social care change dub the ` ` dementia tax ' ' , and means-test the winter fuel allowance . instead , she focus on Brexit with eight of the @card@ bill connect to the UK ' s complex departure from the EU . the PM - yet to strike a deal with the Democratic Unionist party to prop up her minority government - try to put on a brave face . Mrs May say her plan for government would include measure to protect access to UK water that be ` ` so important to Scottish fisherman ' ' . she add : ` ` this be a government with purpose . determine to deliver the good Brexit deal , commit to keep our country safe , enhance our standing in the wide world and bring our United Kingdom closer together . ' ' but as she be quiz on her plan in the commons , she run into trouble when grill on the impact of Brexit on Scots law . Nat MP Stewart McDonald ask her if a legislative consent motion would have to be pass by MSPs - effectively grant permission for Westminster to strip out EU rule from a raft of devolve legislation . she reply : ` ` that ' s a matter be consider here and in Scotland . there ' s a possibility a legislative consent motion may be require in the Scottish Parliament . ' ' but last night public law expert Professor Aileen McHarg say the effect of MSPs refuse a motion would be that ` ` the relevant aspect of the Bill would not extend to Scotland ' ' - unless Westminster try to override Holyrood . the Strathclyde Uni academic say : ` ` I doubt the Scottish Parliament would want to do that , as they ' ll want to ensure continuity of effect for EU law as regard Scotland , which be the main purpose of the repeal bill . they could enact their own version of the legislation for devolve matter , but I have n't see any suggestion the Scottish Government be consider that . ` ` we ' re really talk about ' how ' the repeal bill affect Scotland , rather than ' whether ' it do so . ' ' Mrs May ' s admission that she may need Holyrood ' s go-ahead to press ahead with her Brexit law prompt the Scottish government to claim Westminster be already not play ball over the matter . SNP MSP Joe Fitzpatrick tell Holyrood the repeal bill would be ` ` consider ' ' and warn : ` ` it will then be for the Scottish Parliament to determine whether to give or withhold consent . ' ' the Nat ' Brexit minister Michael Russell add : ` ` the Scottish Government expect to be closely involve with the UK government on propose legislation that affect Scotland and it be time for far more transparency and openness from them and a joint co-operative approach . despite the imminent introduction of the repeal bill , we have not see any of its draft provision nor do we know the proposal .

Mrs May vow to ` ` see Brexit through ' ' , but pledge to ` ` seek to build a wide consensus ' ' . Jeremy Corbyn dismiss the programme as ` ` thin gruel ' ' . the Labour leader say : ` ` this be a government without a majority , mandate and serious legislative programme , lead by a Prime Minister who have lose her personal authority and be struggle even today to stitch up a deal to stay in office . ' ' but his claim to lead a ` ` government in waiting ' ' be mock by the PM , who say he ` ` fight a spirited campaign and come a good second ' ' . last night , the SNP say the agriculture and fishing bill suggest the Tories ` ` intend to centralise power repatriate from the EU , rather than ensure all new power in devolve area automatically become Holyrood ' S responsibility ' ' . but Scottish Secretary David Mundell hit back : ` ` there will undoubtedly be more decision-making power come to Holyrood .

the Sun SAYS Forget Ukip ... vote Tory to get Brexit the Sun today have a simple message for our reader think of voting for Ukip or Labour tomorrow : do n't . let us explain why . Ukip have succeed wildly in its only real aim : to get Britain out of the EU . but it no longer serve any purpose and its leader know it . it be only stand in half the seat nationwide . the Tories alone be commit to see Brexit through in full . they will withdraw us from the single market and custom union , regain control of our border and law and free us to trade independently with the rest of the world . Labour claim it will see Brexit through too . but , as the last few week have prove , it will promise absolutely anything for your vote . its Brexit ` ` strategy ' ' change daily . currently it ' S to insist on free access to the single market . it have no idea what it will do if the EU say no . indeed the Sun do not believe for a second that Brexit would happen under Labour . do not think voting Ukip will somehow ensure the Tories do n't let Brexit slip . Ukip be n't even expect to win any seat . meanwhile Theresa May and her Brexit Secretary David Davis have work on their negotiate tactic for almost a year in government . there be no weakness in their resolve . in fact they be criticise for be too tough with Brussels . the Tories need every former Ukipper ' s vote to win a decent majority to make Brexit happen without opposition party or rebellious MP hold it back . many Sun reader will already be vote Tory . other will fancy Labour because that ' S how they have always vote . if that ' s you , know this : this be not the moderate Labour of Tony Blair . it be not the Labour of Kinnock or even Miliband . your vote would be to install Britain ' s first Marxist government . a generation after the end of the Soviet Union , the dismantle of the Berlin Wall and the collapse of almost every ruinous and oppressive hard-left regime worldwide , you would be help to establish a new one , right here in Britain . it would be the grave mistake this country have ever make . plenty of people have spend a year rage over the damage they think Brexit will do . many of them also back an extremist Labour Party whose effect on the economy would be genuinely cataclysmic . even the monstrous spending and borrowing plan they admit to in their manifesto will destroy hundred of thousand of job and hugely increase tax for all - no , not just the rich . do n't let them convince you this be a gentle adjustment to help public service . it would be just the start . Jeremy Corbyn and John McDonnell have pose as calm and respectable to get elect . it be a gigantic fraud . they be bad man who have spend their life in the company of truly evil people . look at Corbyn on our front page today , rabble-rousing at a rally attend by fanatic from a terrorist group , some dress as suicide bomber and scream for Israel to be gas . it would defy belief , have he and his Shadow Chancellor not also spend decade as Westminster cheerleader for the wicked murderer of the IRA . they and their sinister Marxist aide know this be their only chance of power in a lifetime . if the tight of the opinion poll be right , they could seize it ... and damage Britain beyond repair . their naive young follower and the mega-rich US-based celebrity who back Corbyn be too clueless or careless to see where this lead . but those alive in the bleak 1970s remember an economy cripple by massive union domination and wholesale nationalisation . the light go out . body go unburied . public transport stop . industry be wreck . Corbyn ' S regime would be far bad . the extreme socialism he admire and crave have destroy oil-rich , once-prosperous Venezuela . its starve people be riot . do not let that be our fate . until he take over Labour , Corbyn have never run anything outside of a stop the War meeting . now his young fan want this witless novice in charge of Brexit , our big challenge in peacetime . they want him in charge of a massively expensive and pointless nationalisation programme , a new tax system - and the long recession guarantee to follow . they want him in charge of fight Islamist terrorism . look at our front page again and see where his instinct lie . this man pride himself on voting against every anti-terror law for @card@ year . most of his MP know the truth and try to oust Corbyn . now they dishonestly , disgracefully urge voter to make him Prime Minister . Theresa May say that would make us a global laughing stock . well , be would be laugh . the civilised world would be horrify . Britain would face ruin . those who cast their ballot for it would be to blame - and regret it to the end of their day . the Tories have not run a great campaign . but they be pro-business , pro-jobs and pro-low tax . most poll predict they will win . do not assume it . your vote could make the difference between wake up on Friday to a benign government ready to carry Brexit through ... or the nightmare of hard-left extremist prop up by the SNP from Scotland . make certain you vote tomorrow . even if you have n't do so before , vote conservative . PM Corbyn would be Britain ' s bad error do not assume Tory will win

it ' S time To BREXPLAIN ; NATS ' EU DEMAND To PM ; give us detail , not slogan SNP chief demand ` ` detail not slogan ' ' from Theresa May before her landmark speech on quit the EU .

we be a good , fair and more tolerant country ; Sunday Issue the FIRST Minister ' S NEW Year Message To READERS This year mark the tenth anniversary of the SNP come to power in Scotland . it have be a decade of dominance and landslide election victory for the Nat on one hand , but a shatter independence referendum defeat in @card@ on the other . and with last June ' s Brexit vote throw the immediate political future into turmoil , @card@ may turn out to be the Scottish Government ' s most challenging year to date . write exclusively for the Scottish Sun on Sunday , First Minister Nicola Sturgeon today explain why the next @card@ month will be spend fight to prevent Scotland fall into an economic abyss . last year will surely go down as one of the most difficult and troubling year in modern time . and @card@ be shape up to be just as challenging - not least in how we counter the effect of Brexit and the loom economic catastrophe which be take out of Europe threaten us with . I have say previously that leave the EU and the single market could see a lose decade in term of economic growth and job . we could be talk about a generation of lose opportunity if we do n't keep our place in the world ' s big free trade area . Brexit threaten Scotland with a cost to our economy of around Â£11billion a year by @card@ . Independent research suggest @card@ Scots job would be lose over a decade , with average earnings fall Â£2,000 over the same period . in those circumstance , it would be a dereliction of duty for any First Minister and any Scottish government not to do whatever we can to prevent us be drag over that economic cliff edge . the paper we publish before Christmas show how we could retain our place in the single market even if the rest of the UK leave it . our proposal would protect our place in the single market and support continue free trade across the UK . such a solution would not be without its difficulty , but Prime Minister Theresa May have pledge to give our proposal serious consideration . I intend to hold her to that . but the lack of any clear direction or strategy from the Tory on what ` ` Brexit mean Brexit ' ' actually mean be become a national scandal . fully six month on from the vote , they be unable - or unwilling - to tell people what their position be . that be an unforgivable failure of leadership . and while the Tory Government at Westminster be grip by the language and agenda of its hard-right anti-European faction , the Scottish Tories be now in full-scale sell-out mode . go be the rhetoric of protect our place in the single market , to be replace by meaningless Brexiteer slogan . I have make clear independence must be an option to protect our place in Europe and our national interest , and that remain the case . this year will also mark a decade since the SNP take office , a landmark I be both proud of and inspire by . I ' m proud of our record and believe Scotland have become a good , fair more tolerant country in that time . but I ' m also inspire to go further and do more to tackle the big challenge that still face us as a nation . there remain a huge amount of work to do to make Scotland the country we all want it to be . I will be work harder than ever to help achieve that . the year ahead will be one of the most challenge any of us could imagine . but I welcome those challenge and look forward to build on all we have achieve so far .
wait game it ' S come to something when the First Minister ' s demand for a tiny bit of clarity over the UK Government ' s position on Brexit be regard as outlandish . only on Thursday , Boris Johnson , who really be the Foreign Secretary , announce that the Article @card@ process to begin Brexit would begin in the early part of next year . he do n't pick a date , he do n't even pick a month . at bad he indicate a six-month window but , within hour , No10 have issue a statement slap him down . No10 seem to spend an awful lot of its time slap Cabinet minister down , whether it ' S Brexit Secretary David Davis say there ' s next to no chance of remain in the single market or Trade Secretary Liam Fox brand the whole country as fat and lazy . and , while the UK Government be able to tell its minister what Brexit do n't mean , they ca n't tell the rest of us what it do mean . it ' s be obvious for a long time that nobody do even a tiny bit of homework about the consequence of a Brexit vote - but that be more than three long month ago . that ' S long enough to prepare at least a skeleton of a plan and every day that pass without one only strengthen the hand of the SNP .

I understand the Brexit department have already make clear that it want two minister of state to help prepare for the exit talk . but how the Foreign Office will take to be cut out of the big negotiation in decade remain to be see . add spice to all this be that the third man in the Brexit triumvirate , Liam Fox , have famously strain relation with Davis . the pair run against each other for the Tory leadership in @card@ and there ' s no love lose between them . Fox be also no fan of Boris , regard him as a rather frivolous figure . these three , though , will need to work seamlessly together if Brexit be to work .

Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams say : ` ` it be difficult to see how this can be accomplish without significant change to the current border arrangement . ' ' SF MLA John O'Dowd say : ` ` Exiting the single European market , exit the custom union , create a hard border on the island of Ireland . ` ` Warm word , soft word from Theresa may mean nothing . ' ' Alliance deputy leader Stephen Farry describe Mrs May ' s speech as ` ` catastrophic for Northern Ireland ' ' . he add : ` ` any departure from the custom union and the single market will necessitate a formal border either across the island of Ireland or down the Irish Sea . ` ` a one-size-fits-all Brexit be just not practical . there be too many factor and circumstance particular to Northern Ireland . ` ` yet , these have not yet be recognise and respect by the UK government .

' ' during her speech earlier on Tuesday , the Prime Minister say maintain the common travel area between the UK and Republic of Ireland would be a priority during Brexit negotiation . she say : ` ` No-one want a return to the border of the past . our guiding principle must be to ensure that as we leave the European Union no new barrier to live or do business within our own union be create . ` ` the United Kingdom will share a land border with the EU and maintain that common travel area with the Republic of Ireland will be an important priority .

secret society @card@ PRIME Minister Theresa May seem to think she ' S play a great poker hand by refuse to tell anybody what she ' s up to . but all this secrecy and silence may actually be a mask for absolutely nothing at all and just when it look like Brexit ca n't get any more chaotic , it do . the UK Government be determine to try to set aside last week ' s court judgment which confirm that MP have a right to decide on Brexit . and now , as if to stir the pot , we could be just day away from the Scottish government get involve in Westminster ' S Supreme Court Appeal . if that legal move go ahead and if it be successful , then it ' s go to complicate thing more than a little . as well as two house of Parliament , lord and MP , all have their say on Brexit , it could mean that MSPs be give a vote too . if Holyrood be allow a voice , then why not the Welsh Assembly and the Northern Ireland Assembly just for good measure ? the view from Holyrood be clear . Europe be knot through every strand of the Scottish Parliament . be all of that go to be tear out , tear up and throw away without any chance for MSPs to have a chance ? will Mrs may drive her way through the devolve parliament regardless of what they think ? and if she do , what be that go to do for Nicola Sturgeon ' s independence referendum plan ? it ' s further proof that Brexit be a lot more complicated than anybody think of . incredible as it be to believe , it seem nobody who claim to be in charge have give any of this stuff a moment ' S think . it ' S almost as if they be make it up as they go along . as the Holyrood Brexit Secretary Mike Russell say : ` ` that ' s no way to run a democracy .

EU chief Jean-Claude Juncker clearly have no grasp of history . he underestimate British resolve , even among those who wish we could stay in . they see him browbeat our PM and begin to wonder what they ever really see in the EU . bully voter and impose its will through deceit have work time and again for Brussels . it wo n't this time , with this people .

you ' Re A PLONKER To Cheer AT BREXIT it will come as no surprise that I have be follow the fallout from the UK ' s Brexit vote of June @card@ very closely . there be endless spat and turf war occur in the cabinet of the new British Prime Minister Theresa May . this be not surprising give the rather ' large ' personality of some of the new minister involve . Brexit be bad news from the point of view of currency , business , investment , job and much more . however , there be some people literally raise a glass to the British decision to leave the EU . it seem that wine merchant have have an unexpected boost from the Brexit fallout , with wine sale reportedly reach a five-year high last month . the reason for this be that many of the top French wine be hold in warehouse in the UK and be price in sterling . this mean that when the pound plummet after the vote of the British people to leave the UK , international buyer of very fine wine find that they could benefit from a ten per cent reduction in the price of these very fine wine . I suppose it may be a small consolation to wealthy business owner who see their firm suffer loss in the wake of the Brexit vote - they could drown their sorrow with a nice Bordeaux wine for a fraction of the cost .
Tories Must GET Clear ON BREXIT Britain need to get on the front foot in the Brexit talk . one of the major challenge in any negotiation be to have your draft as the basis for discussion . the government be fail to achieve this . this be , in part , because its proposal be not detailed enough . some of the rumour about Britain not be prepare for the talk be EU gamesmanship . they be very keen to suggest that they be ready and we be not . but Whitehall insider admit the pace of preparation for the Brexit negotiation be not what it should have be - that the government have spend too long make up its mind on various issue and not enough on discuss how to make thing work . much of the blame for this be pin on the pre-election No10 , whose desire to take every decision create a massive bottleneck . I understand that the government be think of a major speech in September - possibly by the Prime Minister - set out more of its thinking on Brexit and transition arrangement . this speech can not come soon enough . for the government need to offer great clarity on what it want our path out of the European Union to look like . at the same time , it must n't forget the reason why Britain decide to leave the EU . any Brexit deal that do n't allow this country to , in time , negotiate its own trade agreement would not deliver the change that the nation vote for .
now be time to back May what be wrong with Tory MP ? yes , Prime Minister Theresa May make a wrong call in hold a snap election , but they should now get behind her to fight for a good Brexit . then , if she do not come up to scratch they can talk about make a change . do n't send her into battle with one hand tie behind her back . Denis Marshall Worthing , West Sussex in her manifesto , Theresa May have a hard line on Brexit while Jeremy Corbyn want a soft approach to leave the EU . the result be @card@ constituency for May and @card@ for Corbyn - which imply May ' S mandate be more popular . so why do politician now think a hard Brexit be out of the question ? just like the referendum vote , politician do n't like the result so try to influence them . Keith Cornish Exeter BEING a so-called working-class conservative , I would like to warn the top knob - if you do not back your Prime Minister it will show you ' re just like the Labour Party ... spineless . you will do irreparable damage to your party ' s credibility for year to come . bill Granger Brighton Tory MP need to get behind Theresa May instead of stab her in the back and let her get on with the job . the public need to look at themselves too for bail out on her in her hour of need and voting for a party that can only lead this country to ruin .

Jacqueline Miller Southport for Theresa May to go ahead with Brexit negotiation will result in an unmitigated disaster . it would be good to delay talk and hold a second General Election later this year . a reinvigorate Tory Party and a leader who have a strong determination to deliver on the referendum , but who also engage the electorate over the issue of most concern , will deliver a huge mandate for Brexit . Raymond Rapson Cheltenham , Gloucs POLITICIANS have call for Mrs May to resign say she should stop Brexit . she do not lose vote over Brexit . she lose vote because she go against OAPs like me because the Tories think they have no opposition and could do anything they want .

true or false THERE be some thing that politician just never do . one of the cardinal rule be not to accuse their opponent of lie . so it be a sign of how desperate relation between the government at Westminster and Holyrood have become when SNP Brexit Minister Michael Russell be prepare to come right out and accuse the Tory government of not tell the truth . his basis for that be this week ' S Supreme Court judgement . it state that the deal forbid Westminster from pass legislation which affect Scotland without Holyrood ' S permission be , for all intent and purpose , worthless . the agreement be actually write into the late version of the Scotland Act . but in spite of all the fanfare and hooplah , it be word in such woolly term that Westminster can pretty much do what it like . that verdict can not be a surprise to anybody - least of all Mr Russell - and he ' S probably more than a little bit please to see it actually write down in black and white . it fit exactly with the SNP version of history that it want to get across and keep on repeat . that be , the notion that the Westminster Government ca n't be trust . that Scotland be be ignore and sweep aside in the rush towards Brexit . so far , at least , there have be no sign that Theresa May and her colleague be willing to acknowledge advice or opinion from anybody else . last week ' s big speech reject everything suggest in the Scottish Government ' s Brexit policy paper contain a firm promise to consider it fully . tellingly , the speech also come before the Welsh Government ' S paper have even be deliver . that be in spite of Mrs May ' s promise just day after take office that she want a Brexit position agree by the whole of the UK . with just week to go before she fire the start gun on Brexit , it would be nice to see the Prime Minister make at least some kind of offer to the devolve nation of the UK . there ' s a big difference between agree with somebody and simply tell them what to do .
the Sun SAYS Crush pro-EU saboteur , PM Sun THE Brexit saboteur of the Commons and Lords must be face down and crush . it be not their blind devotion to the EU we mind . it ' S the fork-tongued deceit . the suggestion they have some noble motive beyond simply reverse the referendum result they can not get over . their ever-so-reasonable concern for ` ` know a few more detail ' ' of Theresa May ' s strategy before back an Article @card@ Bill be entirely phony . article @card@ do only one thing . it serve notice on the EU . it be not dependent on ` ` type ' ' of Brexit . a politician voting for it straightforwardly accept the majority ' s verdict on June @card@ . those delay it with endless amendment intend to kill it , to see their will prevail over the electorate ' S . this affront to democracy be bad enough from the likes of Nick Clegg , the ex-Lib Dem leader whose genius reduce his party from @card@ MP to eight . or Labour pipsqueak Owen Smith , notable only for fail to topple Jeremy Corbyn . but at least they be elect . not so the preposterous Patience Wheatcroft , self-styled chief Brexit denier in the Lords . ` ` it be only right to delay trigger Article @card@ until we have a clear idea of what it entail , ' ' the baroness grandly pronounce - every duplicitous word a new nail in the House of Lords ' coffin . because , make no mistake , that Chamber be on borrow time . it be always controversial for a 21st century democracy to retain an unelected second house . at least we use to value its occasional wisdom . now that it be pack with talentless crony , fleece taxpayer while plot to subvert their will , how can anyone argue for it ? the Lords need total reinvention with far few peer , able still to scrutinise law but unable to thwart the public will or that of the government we elect . it be absurd for Remainers like Wheatcroft to pretend to be still in the dark . the government have pledge post-Brexit to take back control of UK law , include on immigration , and establish ` ` the free possible market ' ' with the EU and beyond . it can not possibly give away its entire negotiate strategy before it sit down with the EU . yet Clegg hope to hold Article @card@ up in the commons until the PM commit to a ` ` soft ' ' Brexit ( ` ` no ' ' Brexit , in other word ) and a second referendum . he be derange by europhilia . Mrs May will not want to call an election next year for many sound reason , practical and political . but if Remainers ' endless amendment stall an Article @card@ bill she must be ready to call their bluff and do so . she would annihilate Corbyn ' s Labour and expose diehard Remain MP to the wrath of their Leave-voting constituent . it be the nuclear option - but a threat she would be mad to rule out .

get to Ruth of the matter be be read out from the Government front bench just a few hour later . Ms Davidson ' s current view be now Brexit Minister David Davis ' s current view . however , her statement be very strongly word and come close to be openly critical of Theresa May . Ms Davidson ' s stern insistence that ` ` no government of the Conservative and Unionist Party should countenance any deal that compromise the political , economic or constitutional integrity of the United Kingdom ' ' sound a lot like a criticism . and it sound a lot like an instruction when she add : ` ` if regulatory alignment in a number of specific area be the requirement for a frictionless border , then the PM should conclude this must be on a UK-wide basis . ' ' Those close to Ms Davidson insist that she be eager to put down a marker . they also believe that her statement be read out as a challenge to Cabinet hardliner like Boris Johnson and Michael Gove to come up with a good plan - if they can . they ca n't . they have be show up by the Brexit mess they create and it will wreck their career - again . the question now be , what will it do for Ruth Davidson ' S career ?

quid PROs Grow ; financial sector ' to double after Brexit ' , say Carney l THE UK ' s financial sector will double in size in the next @card@ year , the Bank of England Governor yesterday predict . Mark Carney say the City and all its asset be already worth ten time more than the annual output of the rest of the country but would flourish post-Brexit . he shrug off fear that the City would lose business to other centre such as Frankfurt , Paris and Dublin . he say : ` ` if the UK financial system thrive in a post-Brexit . world , which be the plan , it will not be ten time GDP , it will be @card@ to @card@ time GDP in another quarter of century because we will keep our market share of cross-border capital flow . ' ' GDP for the UK be about Â£1.9trillion a year . but this be dwarf by the financial sector ' S asset , such as bank and pension fund . Mr Carney say : ` ` it bring a million job , it pay @card@ per cent of tax revenue , it be the big export industry by some token . ' ' but he warn such reliance be risky and urge minister to hold their nerve on scale back regulation . yesterday the Bank vote to keep interest rate at @card@ per cent . but its Monetary Policiy Committee warn they could go up within a year in a bid to curb inflation .
the Sun SAYS fight for Brexit How long will the government continue to give the most rabid Remainers a clear run at rubbish Brexit ? from every pessimistic anecdote and snippet of negativity , they be build a story that Britain be doom . that David Davis be a fool be humiliate by Brussels ' negotiator , that the whole thing be so obviously already a catastrophe it must be reverse . they plainly hope that if they say it loud enough and often enough the public will begin to believe it . the fact be against them . the economy have defy their dire prediction . the weak pound have be a godsend for manufacturer and exporter and bring a huge surge in tourism . yes , inflation begin to rise . then it fall again . record number - and still climb - be in work . the City , which these Remainers reckon will be destroy , be full of confidence and on a hire spree . trade talk with America begin on Monday . more sober Remainers be finally focus on how Britain can make Brexit work well . the staunchly Europhile business group the CBI claim now to be among them . Boss Carolyn Fairbairn insist none of her member want Brexit reverse - merely a transition period , time-limited and ` ` as short as possible ' ' . if so , fair enough . the Sun back that too . after the summer break , our squabble Cabinet minister must unite - and come out fight for Brexit .
the Sun SAYS Back Brexit Almost anything be now Brexit ' S fault . Remainers lap up the glum ` ` forecast ' ' of the Office for Budget Responsibility , even though they be only partly down to the leave vote and the OBR admit to a @card@ per cent chance they ' re wrong . the same odd as a coin toss . where be the government fightback against the barrage of Brexit bellyache from Remain-obsessed commentator , politician and the brazenly bias BBC ? as Tony Blair orchestrate his plot to rewrite history , only eurosceptic backbencher defend 17.4million voter ' will . the government vow to make Brexit a success . it should be loudly defend it .
Let ' s back business not bash it and Brexit will be brill ; City EXPERT BLASTS Elite SNIPING THERE be , once again , several Britain - and they be no longer even speak the same language . Middle England be delight by our new government and its take on the world . the late opinion poll be phenomenal . the Tories have hit @card@ per cent , the sort of height last reach at the @card@ General Election . Theresa May ' S party , buoy by huge support from woman and old voter , have take a 17-point lead against Labour , accord to ICM , its large while in power since @card@ . this triumph have go almost unnoticed , for one simple reason . Elite Britain , a much small but hugely influential section of the population , be aghast and in open revolt . it can not believe that the Tories be truly intent on pull us out of the EU and that they even want to limit immigration . in provincial , post-referendum , post-Blair/Cameron England and Wales , the Prime Minister ' S style , approach and rhetoric chime with the new mood . in Westminster , the City and Canary Wharf , her pronouncement have be meet with incomprehension , anger and another substantial sell-off of the pound . the problem , of course , be that both group be get this wrong . Elite Britain be hopelessly over-gloomy about the future and chillingly contemptuous of democracy . bizarrely for a meritocratic class that be usually so selfconfident in its own ability , it be convinced that the UK be a desperate supplicant , with little to offer . a small minority of its member even seem , at time , to be willing on Armageddon , deduce that only a full-blown financial crisis could yet stop Brexit and convince the public it now so despise of the error of their way . this be madness . but Middle England and the government be also mistake . Brexit be a great opportunity for Britain but it need to be execute correctly . bash business and the free market never work . crude combination of populism , socialism and nationalism inevitably end in tear . the City be a crucial source of job and wealth . it be worth fight for . we need deregulation , not more labour-market rule . we need a migration system that be acceptable to a newly empower country and work for an economy at full employment , not one that be obsess with a target make up on the hoof by the previous government . the government must also remember that kite-flying be not a good way of make economic policy . its loose thought on quantitative easing , fiscal policy and company that hire migrant have rattle the financial market , add to the sense of doom in some boardroom . in reality , the Pound have long be overvalue . its decline will reduce the current-account deficit by redirect consumer to domestic good and service and make it easy for firm to sell ware abroad . but caution be essential in this febrile , nervy atmosphere . the government ' s big mistake so far lie in its approach to Brexit . Plan A be to disclose as little as possible for as long as possible , apart from emphasise that there would definitely be great control on immigration , and get government department to engage in a thorough factfinding exercise . every side would then present its case , the Prime Minister would decide , then she would go into battle . the mantra be all about not give a run commentary and not reveal the government ' s negotiate hand . the problem be that this worthy , rational approach have fail . the Cabinet be at loggerhead on all the fundamental question . it be unclear whether the Treasury be really plan to recycle the appalling forecast of the suppose long-term hit to growth from Brexit that it produce under George Osborne . but the fact that many Brexiteers be convince this be the plan show how toxic the situation have already become . private memo be be leak , official be brief contradictory message . all of this have create a vacuum which the Remainers have fill , while trader have become obsessed with every statement , briefing , or rumour , send the pound and gilt yield yo-yoing . the more we hear , the less we know about what the government would like to achieve in the negotiation , let alone what we will actually end up with . it ' s time for a completely new approach , a Brexit Plan B - and by that I do n't mean a different outcome but a different way of reach it . this be not really about debate in Parliament . this be about the PM lead from the front , and the Brexit department accelerate their work and up their game . May need to start off by make a major , define speech target clearly at Elite Britain , in which she paint a picture of a successful , prosperous and open post-Brexit Britain . she have speak to Middle England - now she need to address business , make it clear that she be confident she will be able to make Brexit an economic success . she need to stress her commitment to maximise free trade , not just with the EU but also with the rest of the world . she would also be well advise to float the possibility of transitional arrangement after @card@ . she need to name-check key industry , include investment banking and car manufacturing , and make it clear that she understand their concern about market access and the need for skilled worker . last but not least , the speech would explain that Britain be a powerful country that make a huge economic , financial , cultural and military contribution to Europe and be therefore in a strong negotiating position . it would need to be accompany by a series of publication from the Brexit department , reassess the cost and benefit of aspect of our EU membership and create much-need intellectual ammunition for Brexit . take the single market . the European Commission think that it have boost EU-wide GDP by just @card@ per cent in @card@ . David Davis need to produce a new estimate of this as soon as possible , and he and Liam Fox must commission study show what the gain to the UK would be be we able to sign free-trade deal with the world . May be in an enviable position and enjoy huge backing from the public . but the UK ' S establishment be increasingly and dangerously alienate from Middle England . to ensure that the UK ' S economy do as well as possible over the next few year , the PM must now focus her effort on reassure corporate Britain . Â© Allister Heath/Telegraph Media Group 6Caution be essential in this febrile , nervy atmosphere @card@ @card@ PM enjoy enviable and huge backing from public7

Mr Brokenshire agree , say that special status would be ` ` the wrong approach ' ' . he add that the government intend instead to look at address individual issue specific to Northern Ireland during Brexit negotiation . this week Sinn Fein launch a campaign in a bid to secure special status for Northern Ireland within the EU after Brexit . speak at Northern Ireland question in the Commons , Mr Brokenshire also renew his pledge to maintain a ` ` frictionless ' ' border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland . but he be accuse of give vague answer on the detail of such an arrangement , as MP press him on the relationship between the two country after Britain leave the EU .
Brexit be far from easy task ; the Scottish Sun ON Sunday SAYS @card@ @card@ @card@ the fallout from the EU referendum be get ever more heated . it be clear that some MP will not accept the result of June @card@ . on Wednesday , @card@ Labour MP welcome a speech by Tony Blair ' S ex-guru Will Hutton in which he say the ` ` overwhelming majority of British people ' ' want to reaffirm our EU membership . he urge MP to fight to overturn the result . and First Minister Nicola Sturgeon insist her Nat MP would oppose any Brexit Bill , follow last week ' s court ruling in London which say Westminster politician should have the final word when it come to trigger Article @card@ .

a new chapter ... now give us a happy ending it be the great shock in modern British political history - and one that almost no one see come . on Thursday evening , the Goves invite several of those who have work on the Brexit campaign and some friend for dinner . several of the guest talk about how their hope be that the margin of defeat would be close enough to keep alive the idea of a second referendum . meanwhile , a confident Number @card@ be worry that Gove might resign if Brexit lose , scupper the plan to reunite the Tory party . Gove himself go to bed before any of the result be in . those at the dinner say he be n't expect Brexit to win when he head up the stair . the first he know of the result be when his team call him at 4.45am , shortly after ITV have call the referendum for leave . they tell him the epoch-making news . around 7am , David Cameron call him to concede defeat . I be tell that , despite the bitterness of the campaign , Cameron be polite and decent . Britain be now in exciting but uncharted water . the most important business face the country be how to leave the EU . Britain , in the word of one Brexiteer , now face ` ` the most complicated negotiation since @card@ ' ' , when Henry VIII meet King Francis I of France to increase the bond of friendship between the two nation . Angela Merkel ' s conciliatory tone be an encouraging indicator that the EU ' s most powerful leader be intent on approach these negotiation in a constructive manner . not every European leader , though , can be rely upon to behave rationally . one influential figure on the leave side warn : ` ` there will be powerful individual who try to muck this up . ' ' Cameron , however , have ensure that it will be the new Prime Minister who determine when to start the process for leave the European Union . some influential Tory be argue that the pro-Leave Justice Minister Dominic Raab , a whip-smart former Foreign Office lawyer , should be send to assess what kind of deal can be make . any new Prime Minister be likely to go to the country to seek a mandate for the aim of their exit talk . one wellplace source on the leave side say : ` ` it be hard to imagine how it would happen without that . ' ' this approach would also ensure that any new Prime Minister have the maximum time between leave the single market and a new General Election . what be vital be that the promise make in this campaign be keep . a failure to do so would be disastrous for people ' S faith in politics . so , immigration policy must be put under UK control , worker ' right must be protect and VAT must be take off domestic fuel . but any new Prime Minister must think of some other policy that would show the world that Britain be still an outward-looking nation which be open for business . cut corporation tax to ten per cent be one idea advocate by several senior figure on the leave campaign . a new chapter in the history of Britain be start yesterday . we now wait to see whether our leader can make it one with a happy ending .

I can be a bloody difficult woman ... as EU chief be about to find out ; Tory Leadership FAVOURITE OUTLINES Her DREAM for POST-BREXIT UK when the country vote in the referendum about Europe a little more than two week ago , the message to politician be clear . we want out of the European Union - and we want serious change in the way politics work . incredibly , lot of our political and business leader have respond by show that they still do n't get it . some politician - democratically-elected politician - have even suggest the government should ignore the referendum result and keep Britain inside the EU . some business leader , rather than planning for Britain ' S departure or think of the opportunity withdrawal present , have choose to complain about the result and criticise the voter . well , I could n't be clear . Brexit mean Brexit . there must be no attempt to remain inside the EU , no attempt to rejoin it by the back door and no second referendum . the country vote to leave the European Union and , as Prime Minister , I will make sure that we leave the European Union . of course , there be some risk in leaving , which be why we need strong , proven leadership to steer us through a period of economic uncertainty . but there be also some great opportunity cause by leave the EU . the government will be able to do more to control immigration to Britain from other European country . referendum be a vote for change we will be able to negotiate our own trade deal with country outside Europe . and we ' ll be able to do lot of common-sense thing , like cut back on red tape and let local council buy British . so we have to seize the chance to get out into the world and help British firm to do business all around the globe . but as I ' ve say , the referendum be not just a vote against our membership of the EU . it be a vote for change - and I understand why . in Westminster , I be sometimes criticise for do politics my own way . as Ken Clarke say about me this week , I can be a ` ` bloody difficult woman ' ' . but as I say afterwards : ` ` Yes , and the European Commission be about to find out . ' ' because I ' m not your typical politician . I do n't tour the television studio , I do n't gossip about people over lunch , I do n't go drinking in Parliament ' S bar . I do n't often wear my heart on my sleeve . I just get on with the job and I think that be the kind of no-nonsense politics people want . they also want a clear , optimistic , positive view of what Britain should look like in the year to come . and this be important , because , while negotiate the deal that get us out of Europe be go to be a big job , we still need to be able to get on with govern the country and change it for the well . my vision be simple but it be bold . I want to make Britain a country that work not for a privileged few but for everyone , regardless of who they be and where they ' re from . because we ' re a long way from that point right now . if you ' re bear poor in today ' s Britain , you will die on average nine year earlier than other . if you ' re black , you ' re treat more harshly by the criminal justice system than if you ' re white . if you ' re a white , working-class boy , you ' re less likely than anyone else in Britain to go to university . if you ' re at a state school , you ' re less likely to reach the top profession than if ' d t d it l ' you ' re educate privately . if you ' re a woman , you still earn less than a man . if you suffer from mental health problem , there ' s too often not enough help to hand . if you ' re young , you ' ll find it hard than ever before to own your own home . these be all appalling injustice and I be determine to fight against them . but the mission to make Britain a country that work for everyone go further than fight these injustice . if you ' re from an ordinary , working-class family , life be much hard than many people in politics realise . you have a job , it but you do n't always have job security . you have your own home but you worry about mortgage rate go up . you can just about manage , but you worry about the cost of living and the quality of the local school - because there ' s no other choice for you . under my leadership , there will never be any doubt about whose side the Conservative Party be on . we be go to put ourselves at the service of ordinary , work people . it be a big job , but we will make Britain a country that work for everyone .

Theresa May and her cabinet look as clueless as Westlife ' s backing singer Kian Egan try to figure out how to mime along to Shane Filan ' s lead on we get ta Little World of Our Own . ` ` Division ' ' be the only result of the Brexit decision so far , with UK consumer confidence implode , lead Leavers admit they wo n't get access to the single market and talk of a unite Ireland no longer the preserve of a diesel-smelling Wolfe Tones fan drive a Massey Ferguson through Tyrone . and then there ' s the Republic of Ireland , put all its hope on a caretaker Taoiseach on his last leg who claim to have do a lot of heavy lifting in Europe over the year . this probably mean he once help carry Angela Merkel ' s luggage into an EU summit where the leader then queue up to pat him on the head . maybe the UK be n't the only country that be clueless when it come to its Brexit strategy after all ...

the Sun SAYS Brexit fightback why be the government not turn its gun on Blair ' s gang of self-confessed Brexit ` ` saboteur ' ' ? why have it abandon the battlefield , give Remoaners free rein to ramp up the hysteria and bolster both their dangerous campaign against democracy and the EU ' s negotiate position ?

Theresa May must answer both question with a bold reshuffle . she should create a new Secretary of State specifically for housing . Sajid Javid , maybe . she should appoint new heavy-hitters into the Brexit department - commit Leavers to take on those who would risk riot or bad to reverse the referendum . do it , Theresa .

' ' Former Ukip leader Nigel Farage accuse Mr Blair of a ` ` loathsome ' ' bid to reverse a democratic decision . he say : ` ` he be show people why he be now one of the most dislike live figure in British politics . he suggest public opinion have shift when there be more people in favour of Brexit now than there be at the time of the referendum ` ` the real irony here , of all the people to argue that we can get a reform deal with the European Union , Tony Blair be probably the worstplaced person to do so . ` ` he be EU president for six month in @card@ . he promise reform on the Common Agricultural Policy and get none - and yet give away Â£7billion of our rebate . ` ` so I do n't think he ' S a trust figure on this or , frankly , anything else . ' ' Junior Brexit Minister Robin Walker add : ` ` by call for the will of the people to be overturn , Mr Blair be demonstrate once again that he be out of touch .

lord will not take kamikaze leap on Brexit THE House of Lords wo n't block Brexit . despite there be no government majority in the Upper House and the fact most peer be pro-EU , the Brexit Bill will make it through . why ? because the reason this unelected chamber still exist in the 21st century it that it have a very strong self-preservation instinct . it know how far it can push thing . to obstruct something back by 17.4million people in a referendum and which just get a House of Commons majority of @card@ , would be suicidal - and the Lords know it . cabinet minister admit initial government talk of abolish the House of Lords if it do n't vote for Article @card@ be ` ` over the top ' ' . ' constitutional crisis ' but the reason David Davis and Theresa May have be use much soft language in the past few day be because they be confident the Lords wo n't do anything stupid . indeed , I understand the Labour front bench have make clear , through the usual channel , that they be n't interested in try to wreck the bill . this do n't mean there wo n't be attempt to fiddle with it . but as one Cabinet minister note , the fact the Commons pass it without any amendment ` ` put a massive pressure ' ' on peer to do the same . another minister point out the government defeat all the amendment in the commons with ease , May ' S majority never dip below @card@ . this mean she would have the vote to strip any amendment out if the Bill be send back to the Commons . the exception to the Lords ' sense of self-preservation be the liberal democrat . ` ` the Lib Dems would love to try to create a constitutional crisis , ' ' warn one senior figure in the Brexit department , point out that they be pro-EU and anti-Lords . but independent peer , whose support be key to defeat the government , will be put off by the Lib Dems ' attitude . they do n't want to bring the house down . once Theresa May have get her Brexit Bill through Parliament , she face the diplomatic challenge of work out when it be good to formally tell the EU that Britain be off . Downing Street now think the Brexit Bill wo n't receive Royal Assent until March @card@ . this mean Theresa May ca n't use the European Council meeting on March @card@ to formally start the process of leave the EU , as key figure in Government have want her to . but it would n't be wise to trigger Article @card@ too close to the Dutch election on March @card@ , where the anti-EU Geert Wilders be expect to top the poll , as this will prompt European leader to circle the wagon . then there be the celebration of the 100th anniversary of the Treaty of Rome on March @card@ . you do n't turn up to an anniversary party with your divorce paper . May , though , be head into these negotiation with a strong hand . not only be the UK economy in far strong shape than the EU expect it to be , but it be also clear that Parliament be n't go to derail Brexit . l James Forsyth be political editor of the Spectator

could it be beer googles that cause Brexit ? what in the name of good God have you do ? and I ' m not talk about the Twelfth ( not yet , anyway ) . or Theresa May or thingie Leadsom ( but I will ) . no , I mean Brexit . now the dust have settle , we know this be go to go on for year . I be n't in favour of an exit , and I ' m proud to say the majority of those who vote here share my view . I ' m not go to claim that those of us who vote to remain be clever or good than those of you who vote to leave , there be genuine argument on both side . sadly , both political camp fight the debate decide to ignore fact in favour of campaign base on fear . and it be fear of unfettered immigration to the UK from the EU that seem to have tip the balance in favour of withdrawal . once again , the promise of controlled immigration by the Brexit campaign be another lie that can not be deliver . if the UK want to continue to trade within the EU - and remember , it ' S not only our big market now , but always will be - then one of the basic tenet of such trade be free movement of worker . it be soon obvious nobody in power ever really believe there would be a vote to leave , so nobody have any idea what to do when that become the reality . Brexit be akin to those night when , and we ' ve all do it , buoy by too much to drink , we see the partner of our dream . Nature take its course and have go to bed with a thing of beauty , we waken to a beast snore beside us . at that moment , there be only two possible course of action : either we get up and make our new friend breakfast or Ninjalike , we sneak from the bedroom , dress on the way to the car . Nigel Farage prove himself a sneak in that as soon as a win be announce , he announce he be resign from Ukip , leave the mess he ' d just create for other to try and work out . Prime Minister Cameron who promise he ' d stay on whatever the result announce his immediate departure . I mean , can we believe anything politician say , ever again ? it look like bumble Boris Johnson would be a shoe-in for the Tory leadership and PM designate until the embodiment of a Dickensian villain , Michael Gove , make his move . Gove announce that even after have work with him for the whole of the Brexit campaign , he ' d suddenly decide he could n't support Boris and want the PM job himself . but the drama be far from over . the next obvious Tory candidate for PM , Theresa May , suddenly find herself in a face off with new girl on the block , Andrea Leadsom . Andrea decide to come out swing and a womb war be declare , with claim by Leadsom to a reporter that her be a mum mean she ' d more invest in the future of the country compare to her barren opponent . chauvinistic , misogynistic male around the country wince at this example of post-feminism and the medium go into meltdown . it be n't really a surprise that Leadsom then withdraw from the contest , leave the key of number @card@ in the hand of May . this mean the Tory Minister who vote to remain will be the one leave work out the mechanic of how to leave . once again , the law of unintended consequence have play out . one of the top complaint by many within the Brexit camp be they be sick of be govern by unelected Eurocrats . well , now they have a new Prime Minister not even vote in by the member of her own party . while Theresa May look the big winner from the Brexit vote , that title may in fact belong to Scotland ' s SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon who be push for , and will inevitably get , another vote on Scottish Independence due to the result . juxtapose Northern Ireland First Minister , Arlene Foster - fixate on call NI ' our wee country ' - with the statesmanlike Nicola Sturgeon stridently fight for Scottish Independence . if Sturgeon get her way for another referendum , and the vote go her way then the ' our wee country ' Arlene often comment on will reside within a much diminish UK . and , while at present Arlene can reject any call for a border poll , if Scotland vote to leave the UK a precedent will have be set that can never be undo , somewhat like Brexit itself . take this one simple reality - unionist who would never have consider take an Irish passport be now see the practical advantage in have one , with rumour that application form be even run out in East Belfast . remember only two week have pass since the vote for Brexit and the whole political horizon have change forever . we ca n't even begin to imagine what more damage will ensue as the actual exit begin .

Paris do n't even make the top @card@ . so consider Brexit doommongering as just another form of lobbying . the Brexit threat be the perfect excuse for big business to demand low tax and less regulation . it be notable that even though the indebted government be desperate for cash , it be continue its commitment to low corporation tax - currently just @card@ per cent , one of the low of all major economy ( and considerably low than personal income tax rate of @card@ , @card@ and @card@ per cent ) . but EU leader look with jealous eye at the finance industry and the huge tax it pay into Westminster ' S coffer . the EU will try as hard as it can to drag business away from the City over the come year . but it try before , when the UK choose not to join the euro . and it lose out - @card@ per cent of all global trading of euros occur in London . however , the game have change .

free us from Euro judge Theresa May must make good on her pledge to free us from the vice-like grip of the European Court of Justice . when it come to decision regard Brexit , how can we trust the ECJ to be impartial ? the idea of independent panel to overview any dispute make much more sense .

Sun THE SAYS the sole choice for our new PM Theresa May must be Britain ' S next Prime Minister . the Home Secretary be by far the most experienced and most credible of the two final contender to run the country at this pivotal moment in our history . it may seem odd for us to endorse her after our campaign to leave the EU . Mrs May back Remain , albeit reluctantly . but she have promise ` ` Brexit mean Brexit ' ' and we believe she would deliver it . it would be politically suicidal - and dangerous - to betray the 17.4million people who vote for it . Andrea Leadsom do back Brexit . but three day ago we say she would be a huge gamble as PM and we believe that even more strongly today . Britain know nothing about her or her ability . she be untested at Cabinet level . there be question-mark over her finance and apparently mislead job claim on her CV . she have be unconvincing when question . she be nowhere near ready for power . Mrs May ' s record at the Home Office be not perfect . she fail , for example , to make big cut to the immigration she could control , from non-EU country . but it speak volume that she have hold down that extremely tough role longer than anyone in history . damage for Britain to be rudderless it be true she have be so narrowly focus on it that she have yet to reveal her wide vision for Britain . we urge her to tell the nation , and Tory member , all about it right away . Post-Brexit , a ` ` safe pair of hand ' ' wo n't be enough . Britain need a new economic plan to transform the country . Business Secretary Sajid Javid have imaginative idea for cut tax and build business confidence . do Mrs may agree ? what be her view on the welfare reform pioneer by Iain Duncan Smith ? or on education , or defence ? the @card@ Tory member who will decide who become PM must ask themselves this : who will well run Britain - and win an election in @card@ ? anyone would beat Jeremy Corbyn . but if Labour have a credible leader by then , Mrs May have a far great chance than Mrs Leadsom of keep power . we be hugely disappoint Michael Gove be out of the race . he be a man of courage , principle and imagination who would have be a fine choice . we hope he will be appoint head of the negotiate team as we extricate ourselves from the EU . the excellent Priti Patel should be in the Cabinet too . we hope Chancellor George Osborne retain a prominent role . it be absurd that Britain must wait till September @card@ for a new Prime Minister , while our current one kick back and tick off the day . it be hugely damaging for Britain to be rudderless for so long . for the sake of the country , the Tories must cut that voting period in half . we believe they should put Mrs May in Downing Street as soon as possible .

Let ' s see May ' s Brexit strategy Andrea Leadsom ' s quest to be our next Prime Minister end as it begin - in farce and failure . some might praise Mrs Leadsom for quit upon realise she be n't up to the task . not us . from the outset of the contest she appear too inexperienced to be a serious candidate to lead the country , and under the first real scrutiny Leadsom and her campaign fall apart . a single newspaper interview should n't be enough to derail even the most junior MP , yet Leadsom ' S bungle effort with the Times last Saturday betray a dreadful lack of judgment . she have show she ' S entirely unsuite for high office and the wisdom of the @card@ Tory MP who back her must now be question . worse still , her overconfidence and risible retreat have rob Britain of a proper contest - something the Sun call for from the start . Theresa May might be the right choice for next PM , but it ' S concern that her plan for the country have n't be fully examine before she move into Downing Street . the last time the UK witness a competent Cabinet minister take the top job without any competition - when Gordon Brown succeed Tony Blair - the result be disastrous . we sincerely hope Mrs May have the right idea for Britain , and her speech yesterday be a good start . she ' s right to pinpoint the inequality in society , and her idea to put employee on company board to curb the salary of greedy fatcats be welcome . but it ' S on Brexit that ' reluctant remainer ' Theresa May will really be test . Mrs May yesterday repeat her mantra that ` ` Brexit mean Brexit ' ' and rule out any attempt at a second referendum . this be the right stance and both this and her economic proposal show she understand that million of people across Britain have have enough of the status quo - where unchecked immigration and a London-centric economy benefit the very rich while the rest lose out . but to convince the country she ' s serious about make Brexit work , Mrs May must ensure her Cabinet make use of all the talent in the Tory Party - in particular appoint a capable Brexiteer , such as Michael Gove , to lead negotiation with Brussels . we ' re please that David Cameron have move quickly and Theresa May will be PM on Wednesday . this will provide the country and the economy with some much-need certainty . then we need to see a clear plan for Britain leave the EU as quickly as possible . the Tory leadership contest might be over , but the real test for May be just begin .

' ' Those whose big concern be the risk want to hug the EU close . while those excite by the opportunity want as much freedom for the UK to do its own thing as possible . there be another , more political , element to the argument , too .

May promise minister they would have another discussion on Brexit as soon as they come back from their Christmas break . this be take as a sign she will not give her next speech on what kind of trade deal the UK want until after that . but there be some hint as to where May be go . one of those who know her good say she be take by Liam Fox ' s point that more and more trade standard be be set at a global level . a minister who have sit around the Cabinet table with her for year , tell me : ` ` by the end of the meeting , she have get everyone where she want them .

' ' Ms Sturgeon will this month reveal her plan for a separate Scots Brexit deal if the UK can not guarantee Britain stays in the single market . if Downing Street knock it back , she aim to go for a second independence vote before we quit the EU . but the poll finding make grim reading for the SNP and Ms Sturgeon , with her personal approval rating plunge nine point since August . despite a boom in indy support in the day after the Brexit vote , Yes backing slump to @card@ per cent , with no on @card@ and the other @card@ per cent say they do n't know or will not vote . with the undecided and nonvoter exclude , the split be @card@ for Yes and @card@ for no . the survey also reveal a grow majority oppose Ms Sturgeon ' s plan to hold a second indy vote during two year of EU divorce talk - due to start by the end of March . with ' do n't know ' remove , @card@ per cent oppose and @card@ per cent back a re-run of the @card@ vote while the Article @card@ negotiation be ongoing . that gap have widen from @card@ in March . and in a further blow , one in five loyal Nat reckon the party should not campaign for a UK split over the next two year .

March of May could foil veto ambush clot TWO thing be now clear after Britain ' s sensational vote to leave the EU . first , we can kiss goodbye to any trade deal with Brussels unless we accept open border and carry on pay into EU coffer . second , thanks to those bitter Remoaners who refuse to accept the verdict of the British people , we be face the threat of yet another election . the Prime Minister insist she want Parliament to run its full five-year term and probably mean it . a fresh contest barely two year after David Cameron ' s outright Tory victory would be a distraction just as she need to focus all her time and energy on Brexit . but her hand be be force . the Supreme Court be be ask to overrule the PM and give Parliament a veto before she fire the start gun for Brexit next March . and in a blatant bid to reverse the June @card@ referendum result , the two most useless party leader in modern British politics have open a second front . ` ` Red Ed ' ' Miliband and clueless Nick Clegg - cast into oblivion by the great British public - be plot a Commons ambush which could bring down the government . meanwhile , grumpy Chancellor Philip Hammond be apparently threaten to quit the Treasury . Remoaners should be careful what they wish for . Theresa May have notch up astonishing approval rating as the most popular Tory leader since Margaret Thatcher . her party have a 17-point lead over Labour , which can only increase when Jeremy Corbyn ' S pro-Kremlin Loony Tunes be put to the test in a real campaign . and she have strong card to play over the come week , include an autumn minibudget , which will aim to reassure voter that Britain be in safe hand - whoever be Chancellor . it will be follow by a March Budget set Britain ' s course for Brexit , at the same time as she trigger Article @card@ to quit the EU . event might overtake her . revolting Tory could support the Miliband/Clegg plot , trigger a vote of no confidence and plunge us into an election . she could lose the argument in the Supreme Court . and she could be sabotage by EU leader who want to punish Britain for put democracy first . but all these possibility should be weigh against the likely outcome . Theresa May be popular across the political spectrum - include many Labour voter . there be every prospect she would sweep the country , boost her majority and destroy Jeremy Corbyn and his Labour Party Trots . in that event , the Remain camp be dead in the water . Brexit will have win twice . so a Commons revolt be not a foregone conclusion . those favour a ` ` soft ' ' Brexit have respectable argument . but hardliner such as ex-ministers Anna Soubry and Nicky Morgan be begin to look like bulgingeyed fanatic . many who vote Remain out of loyalty to David Cameron be privately pro-Brexit . other have embrace it as the will of the people . voter see Mrs May as a ` ` breath of fresh air ' ' . Jezza , by contrast , be mad , bad and dangerous to know . above all , career-conscious Tories know which side their bread be butter . they be aware this PM do not forgive and forget - as scaremongering George Osborne and other have find to their cost . with their seat up for grab in the new boundary review , will they risk a comfy life in Westminster for the chill wind of the real world outside ? lMET chief Bernard Hogan-Howe have be absolve of all blame for smear public figure with unfounded allegation of child abuse . Sir Bernard , perhaps the most discredited police commissioner ever to hold the post , have choose to quit with a huge pension just as the muck hit the fan . instead , his officer will carry the can for smear innocent public figure such as ex-MP Harvey Proctor and former Home Secretary Lord Brittan , who die without know he have be clear . Hogan-Howe cover his back last week with a socalled ` ` apology ' ' to blameless war hero and former Defence supremo Lord Bramall . the scathing report into the Yard ' s blunder crime investigation under his leadership will not be publish in full . he ' s mad , bad and dangerous

put YOUR Hans UP ; German call for UK ' s ' total surrender ' on EU BREXIT Shock @card@ Germany want Britain ' s unconditional surrender over Brexit talk .

Britain ' S Â£65BN BREXIT Bonanza ; EXIT ' S ' tax CUTS & Growth Boom ' Britain be set for a Â£65billion Brexit boost of tax cut and spending splurge , economist predict . leave the EU will trigger a boom big enough to raise NHS funding and slash the national debt , they say . and the benefit could be feel by million of family within just five year . the upbeat forecast be reveal yesterday in a report by a group of @card@ expert know as the economist for Free Trade . it say Brexit will bring gain as we stop pay our Â£10billion sub and be free from EU red tape that cost business Â£120billion a year . the report say price will fall when we scrap EU tariff on good from the rest of the world , with UK firm enjoy an export boom . this will push up growth to nearly three per cent a year , leave a surplus of Â£40billion by @card@ , and Â£65billion five year later . it would give Chancellor Philip Hammond enough headroom to pay off the debt and also give away Â£25billion a year . almost half of that could be use to soak up a 2p cut on both corporation tax and high rate income tax . that would leave Â£13billion - enough to pump Â£250million a week into the NHS . the group ' S chairman Prof Patrick Minford say the Treasury have be negative about post-Brexit Britain and urge Mr Hammond to show ambition in next week ' S budget .
a Grand EU Tour WITHOUT THE MAP Britain have trigger Article @card@ to depart the European Union - without a real clue about how it ' s go to go about it . Ireland be horribly expose to the fallout but Taoiseach Enda Kenny ' S strategy be still non-existent . Enda , above , be expect shortly to outline a list of priority . but we know what those priority be : we do n't want a hard border with the North and we want some form of free movement of good , service and people between the Republic and Britain . what we do n't really know be the strategy Enda will employ to good achieve these Brexit priority . in recent month , he have travel all over Europe , visit Germany , Poland , Malta several time , Spain , Brussels , also multiple time , and Britain . at no point have he outline what this i dti expensive and timeconsuming tour have achieve . Enda claim it be all about gain support for Ireland ' S position . how can he be lobby other member state to back an Irish strategy which simply do not exist ? Ireland have only two option : Brexit be about @card@ member state versus the UK , Ireland be part of the 27-member bloc and it must either join it by impose the tough , harsh Brexit on the UK to ensure no one ever leave again , or it lobby on behalf of British interest in order to secure a special case for Ireland . the Taoiseach have use Brexit to bolster his effort to hold on to office . it ' s time he make it clear what the Irish strategy be , rather than outline a wishlist with no explanation on how to achieve it .

I wish Parly would grow up and stop the hysteria I Know we have only just dismantle the Christmas tree and tangle the fairy light into an inextricable knot for another year , but I ' ve already decide what I ' m put in my next letter to Santa Claus . you might think of it as a New Year ' S resolution , I see it more as an impossible dream but , this year , I ' d like to see a tiny bit less excitability in Scottish politics . I think it would be lovely if we could all just calm down a wee bit . we might even try to develop an attention span , keep our eye open and remember what happen yesterday , the day before or even ten minute ago . as an example let ' s take last week ' s stramash-ette over the First Minister and her comment on a second independence referendum . Great be the excitement when Ms Sturgeon go on the wireless and announce that she be ` ` willing to put aside my preferred option of independence in the EU to see if we can explore a consensus and compromise option . ' ' incredible ! unbelievable ! Nicola Sturgeon be publicly back-pedal on her scary threat of Scottish independence . she be actually say that she might not hold another referendum if the UK can avoid a hard Brexit for Scotland . so thrill be this admission that Scottish Tory leader Ruth Davidson be require to go on UK wide news broadcast to comment on these development . and , as you might imagine , Ruth do not hold back . this be the live proof , she say , that SNP attempt to use the Brexit lash-up to build support for independence have fail dismally . the First Minister be blow hot and cold on a new referendum because she know it could not be win . Ooooh uncertainty . Ooooh damaging . also other stuff . naturally this all go down very well with colleague in England and , indeed with colleague in Scotland . there ' S just one teeny tiny problem . the First Minister have not change her position even in the slight . on the day of the Brexit vote Nicola Sturgeon announce her plan for another referendum on independence but she stress that it be less important than sort out an EU deal for Scotland . she say it again at the SNP conference in October . she have say it constantly , almost every day , in the past six month . she say it over and over when she present her list of demand for a separate Scottish EU deal just before the Christmas recess . indeed , she repeat it during last week ' s radio interview when she say : ` ` we ' ve put forward how we think this can be do - of keep Scotland in the single market while continue to protect free trade across the rest of the UK - and say very clearly , of course , that would require additional power for the Scottish Parliament . ' ' she add : ` ` I ' m never go to stop argue for independence . I think Scotland will become independent and I think that ' s the direction of travel but we ' re talk at the moment in the context of the Brexit vote . we ' re talk here in the particular context and timescale of Brexit . ' ' only yesterday the First Minister say it again in another interview on the Andrew Marr Show . Ms Sturgeon insist she be not ` ` bluff ' ' on the promise of a second independence referendum if Scotland be ` ` drive off a hard Brexit cliff ' ' . now , if I have reliable power of prediction , I ' d be spend my day fill out betting slip in my local bookie and cash in on the National Lottery instead of sit with bleed finger hunch over a hot word processor . but I be willing to bet that yesterday ' S interview will prove just as controversial as last week ' S interview and Ruth Davidson will be just as outrage by those comment rut as she be by the last one . there will be more weep and wail and gnash of tooth , more talk of U-turn and damaging uncertainty ... blah , blah , blah . in fact , all that have happen be that Nicola Sturgeon have continue to say what she have be say for six month - if anybody have be listen . listen to what she say : if Westminster help Scotland to get a deal with Europe , a soft Brexit which would let us keep our trade link with the EU open , then there will be no new Indy vote . but that ' S not go to happen . half a year after the Brexit vote Nicola Sturgeon be still the only politician in Britain who have come up with even a shadow of an outline of a sketch of what to do , but Theresa May be not go to allow it . there be no way the Prime Minister be go to give Holyrood another huge basket of power - the power Ms Sturgeon say would be e need to make a separate EU deal for Scotland work . control over immigration ? control over employment law ? the First Minister might as well demand control over unicorn farm . it ai n't happen . of course , Nicola Sturgeon know that . nobody get everything they want from any negotiation but a little bit of compromise would be nice . it would be nice if Theresa May do what she say she be go to do and hold off from press the button on Brexit until there be an agreed UK position . an agree position . not an impose position . so we ' re back at square one , exactly the same place we be back in June when the First Minister say an independence referendum must be in place to give the Scottish people a choice . if that parachute be not there it ' s an admission that Westminster can decide whatever it like for Scotland , the good Brexit deal or the bad Brexit deal , and the two third of Scot who vote to remain will just have to suck that ' s what Ruth Davidson want for us . in her view - and it ' S a respectable view - there be nothing that Westminster could ever do that ' S bad than independence . at least Nicola Sturgeon think we should have a choice . ' Nicola Sturgeon be still the only politician in Britain who have come up with a plan ' First Minister have n't change her position
NATS : ..Oh yes there be the Nat be to demand Holyrood be give the legal right to stop Scotland leave the EU . Brexit Minister Mike Russell say the government will decide within day whether to send our top prosecutor to help fight Theresa May ' s appeal at the UK Supreme Court . the MSP also claim Westminster must accept the role of devolve parliament before the PM start the process of cut tie with Brussels . he insist : ` ` we have to consider the benefit of have the Scottish Government represent . ' ' Mr Russell say it ` ` have never be more clear ' ' that Holyrood must give permission for change in its power and responsibility - and this could be an issue for the court . he say : ` ` there should be a role for all the parliament - they ca n't be shove to one side . ` ` Theresa May ' s determination to plough on with a plan she do n't have be very foolish . ` ` we must be involve in anything that alter the competency of Holyrood . Theresa May ca n't ignore that . ' ' he go on : ` ` the people of Scotland would draw their own conclusion from a situation where there be a contempt for our legislative process and view . ' ' we tell last week how High Court judge in London order Mrs May to get permission from Westminster before she can formally trigger Brexit . the SNP threaten to send Lord Advocate James Wolffe QC and lawyer to fight her appeal at the Supreme Court . meanwhile , ex-Scots Secretary Lord Forsyth of Plean , below , insist the House of Lords will not try to stall Brexit . he say : ` ` for an unelected peer to try to overturn the outcome of the referendum be just foolish . ` ` the Lords have a long standing commitment that we do not oppose matter in the manifesto . ` ` the question be just whether we push the starter button , whether we say ' we want a divorce ' . ` ` the Commons would look ridiculous if it prevent the government take the first step towards leave and the Lords understand its constitutional position .

role model Many voter do n't take kindly to celebrity foist their political view on the public . sermon about independence from expat Scot star can fare even bad .

McGregor be one of these people . opinion have now settle back to an anti-indy majority , high than polling day two year ago . but the Union be far from safe . many Scot have be leave uncertain , even afraid , and - as McGregor put it - totally confuse . we do n't yet have a clue what Brexit will mean for our fortune within the United Kingdom . we ' ve hear little more than empty rhetoric come out of Downing Street . No10 ' S priority appear to be curb immigration rather than stay in the single market - all while try to paint the SNP as the rabid nationalist of the piece . meanwhile , as each day pass , the SNP government be edge Scotland closer to a second indy vote , despite have no clear economic plan to avoid us be saddle with a Â£15billion annual spending shortfall . Brexit have leave us up to our eyeball in muddle . while we do n't want to start a trend of look to celebs for political guidance , McGregor do seem to be on the ball - especially for a guy who live @card@ mile away . maybe we should make the Star Wars actor a one-man focus group . when he ' S make up his mind , at least we ' ll know we ' re get somewhere . as Princess Leia might say : ` ` help us , Obi Wan Kenobi . you ' re our only hope .

Brussels can not afford to give a centimetre , let alone an inch . any gain for Britain be a loss for the creak EU . indeed , Europe ' S declare aim be to make Britain WORSE off . the nightmare of an ex-member state flourish outside its border be intolerable . other will want what we ' re have . so be the loss of our Â£12bn a year membership fee , cripple EU finance . if they ca n't stop us from leave , Brussels will use any ` ` transition ' ' to damage Britain ' S economy , steal our financial market and divert a post-Brexit flood of foreign investment away from our shore . cheerleader for Europe , head by the BBC , be dismay by the huge vote of confidence in the UK from global titan like Google , Amazon and Apple ... ` ` despite Brexit ' ' , as they weasily insist . they have be throw off balance by a boom in export and the failure of every single Project fear prediction to come true . the London-based Â£12bn Diageo drink giant put its money where its mouth be last week , predict Britain will thrive ` ` with or without a deal ' ' with Brussels . respected ex-Bank of England governor Mervyn King say we will look back at growth figure in year to come and be unable to spot where Brexit take place . yet all these upbeat prospect be at risk thanks to the highhanded meddling of Philip Hammond and the prophet of doom . never-end talk would wash up against the @card@ general election - if the embattled government can survive that long . blame for all routine economic turbulence will be lay on Brexit . then there be the American election .

Ex-Blair aide Jonathan Powell , a lead Remainer , give the game away . ` ` the debate be move towards stay in the single market , at least for a transitional period - and maybe that period will become indefinite , ' ' he gloat . the only beneficiary from this chaos would be Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn , salivate at the prospect of lead Britain ' s first Marxist regime . the Chancellor claim the Cabinet back his plan to kick Brexit into the long grass . this be rubbish .

how dare Juncker blame a racist murder on Brexit BREXIT shame be the last refuge of the resentful Remainers . they lose the referendum . their dark warning about economic collapse prove to be unfounded . World War Three do not start . there be every indication that our country will have a happy , prosperous future outside the crumble EU . so all they have leave be Brexit shame . all the little European loser have leave be smear those of us who vote to leave as stupid , racist , gullible bigot . Brexit shame run from Brussels to the BBC . as it become clear that there will be no second referendum , it become more shrill , hysterical and vicious . Jean-Claude Juncker , inset , President of the European Commission , claim 17million naive British moron vote to leave because we swallow ` ` @card@ year of lie ' ' . Unforgivably , Juncker even blame the horrible murder of Arkadiusz Jozwik in Harlow on the British vote to leave . ` ` Europe can never accept Polish worker be harass , beat up or even murder in the street of Essex , ' ' say Juncker , to rapturous applause in the chamber . how dare this boozesoaked bureaucrat imply that those of us who vote for our independence from his corrupt , jobdestroying EU be somehow less appall by the murder of an innocent man ? you would never guess that there be a long list of EU national who have commit horrible crime in this country .

I be proud that more than 17million of my countryman defy all the doom-mongers and vote to leave the EU . the Brexit shamers should look in the mirror and reflect on the poisonous contempt they feel for the will of all those British people . because that be exactly why they lose . a chorus of voice on the Left assure us that there be no prospect of the European Union ever start its own army . ` ` a fantasy !

Anti-Brexit fact be there for all to ; AFTER WE Reveal EU Guest Bias ... SO now we know . the BBC hate Brexit so much it have four time more pro-EU guest on its flagship politics show than those who vote leave . unsurprisingly , this important piece of research - publish yesterday in the Sun - trigger a hissy fit by our publicly fund national broadcaster . one newspaper reporter who ask its press office for a statement be even threaten with ` ` Twitter bomb ' ' - a form of online attack - if she dare to quote the Sun ' S statistic . its aggression suggest it have something to hide . yet the fact be there for all to see , and they only confirm what most fair-minded people have long suspect - the BBC be run by a pro-EU metropolitan elite which be out of tune with the majority who , let ' s not forget , vote for Brexit . free drink let ' s look at the evidence . I recently ask the Corporation for a list of every guest it invite to the prom this summer . the answer be very revealing . boss spend Â£19,020 entertaining dozen of luvvies and politician . and guess what ? the vast majority of those treat to free drink and a night at the Royal Albert Hall - courtesy of TV licence payer - be vocal defender of the EU and prominent critic of Brexit . they include Bank of England Governor Mark Carney , London Mayor Sadiq Khan , David Attenborough , Judi Dench , Tory politician Lord Patten , Financial Times editor Lionel Barber , Guardian editor Katharine Viner and ex-Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg . Theresa May , Chancellor Philip Hammond and Labour ' S Jeremy Corbyn - who all back Remain - also accept a free ticket and be host on separate night in a private box by Â£450,000-a-year BBC director-general Lord Hall . by contrast , I count just two prominent pro-Brexiteers among the invitees , one of whom be Transport Secretary Chris Grayling . the BBC may argue it do not deliberately exclude Brexiteers from the guest list , but that be beside the point . here be the proof that its executive routinely rub shoulder in private with those who share their view . they just ca n't help it . another example relate to Nigel Farage . last month he make a formal complaint to the BBC after it broadcast a story link him to the violent death of a Polish man shortly after the Brexit vote . the corporation air the very serious charge - make by a member of the public with the apparent encouragement of a BBC journalist - that Farage have ` ` blood on his hand ' ' for the fatal attack on Arkadiusz Jozwik because of his role in the EU referendum campaign . a court case a few week ago prove this be nonsense . Farage then reveal this allegation have cause him and his family ` ` more misery than any other in my @card@ year in politics ' ' , with people regularly abuse him in the street . yet despite the BBC ' S highly questionable coverage , it have refuse to publicly apologise . it can not bear to admit it be wrong - or to say sorry to a man whose view it despise . compare its treatment of Farage with its adulation of Nick Clegg . he have be give free rein this week to plug his new book , unsubtly title how to stop Brexit , on BBC TV and radio . Clegg ' s pro-EU view help cost him his Sheffield seat at the last election after the city vote for Brexit in the referendum . but in the cosy bubble inhabit by the BBC , such consideration be apparently irrelevant . this delusional politician have be welcome with open arm to use the BBC ' S platform to spout his anti-democratic ideology . it be as though the 17.4million vote cast in favour of leave the EU do not count . in July , a cross-party group of @card@ MP write to the BBC complain it be heavily ` ` in favour of those who wish to water down or even reverse the referendum decision ' ' . their letter follow research painstakingly compile over month by the pressure group News-Watch , which claim that Radio @card@ ' s coverage of Brexit be bias , with listener two-and-a-half time more likely to hear a pro-EU speaker than an anti-EU one . but BBC head of news James Harding reject their call for new anti-bias guideline to be draw up . he tell them the BBC ' S job be not to be ` ` push or pull by one political interest or another ' ' . and , laughably , he say it be ` ` impartial ' ' on the EU . regular payment yet amazingly , its pro-EU tentacle have even get a grip on a programme like Countryfile on BBC1 . earlier this year an edition of the agriculture show interview strawberry farmer Anthony Snell , who say that his business would fail ` ` catastrophically ' ' without migrant worker . many viewer be outrage at this one-sided , pro-EU view , but the BBC see nothing wrong with it . but then again , should we be surprise ? a few year ago I discover that the BBC receive regular payment from the EU via a littleknown scheme call the EU Framework Programme for Research and Development . between @card@ and @card@ it accept Â£2.7million . the most recent grant , during the last financial year , be for Â£1.35million . this money be not use for editorial purpose , but you have to ask why the BBC , which receive a guarantee Â£3.5billion a year from the public , be tap the EU for yet more cash . you also have to wonder - how impartial and objective can the BBC be when it come to the EU , give it be on its payroll ?

' ' Ahead of last week ' S referendum , some expert point out that victory for leave campaigner would not necessarily lead to a Brexit . PM David Cameron have since concede defeat and tell how he will resign - but he have decline to trigger Article @card@ . and it be that move , the formal beginning of a two-year withdrawal process , which Dr Murkens reckon be a huge responsibility for any PM . he say that constitutionally , the UK be not a ` ` centralise ' ' state and , while Westminster be sovereign , it could not hope to unilaterally pull Scotland and Northern Ireland out of the EU without consequence . he add that for Northern Ireland , Brexit would mean ` ` unpick ' ' the good Friday Agreement - which be the source of Stormont ' S power .

Jackie Lewis Pattingham , Staffs Boris be right . the minimum wage should be raise quicker . if it be increase to Â£8 now , the government would save money in benefit payout and rake in tax . trouble be , it ' S not the Tory way .

Theresa May have pick three stalwart Eurosceptics - Boris , Davis and Liam Fox - to lead the process . they will want to proceed as painlessly as possible with a surgical amputation . but if Brussels wo n't help us escape this tangle of bureaucracy in a process of mutual co-operation , we must be ready to wield the axe .

I would feel less suspicious be people like David Davis , Liam Fox and Nigel Farage give great prominence .

Â£10bn Brexit windfall can help boost all our plan ; the Sunday Issue Tory VETERAN ON Benefits of Speedy WITHDRAWAL From EU PROSPERITY , not austerity , be what we want now . Theresa May ' s agenda to promote good life for the many be exciting . we need more and better-paid job in many part of the UK . we need more road and railway line and more fast broadband to link our city and rural area in to global opportunity . we need cheap energy to power industrial revival and take people out of fuel poverty . we need more affordable home for people to buy as we rekindle an ownership revolution . ` ` Everyone an owner ' ' be a crucial part of create a more united and prosperous UK . we wish to move away from a world of ` ` have yacht and have not ' ' to a world where own a car and a home of your own be achievable for the many . it be important that Brexit do not hang over us allow critic to dwell on uncertainty and risk . all the time we delay , it remind us of the division the referendum debate cause , set the well-off and privileged , along with Scotland , against the rest of England and Wales . Theresa May be right not to want Brexit to dominate or define her Premiership . send a clear , early signal on Brexit reduce the risk from business uncertainty and speed the benefit gain from exit . far from be an irrelevance or diversion from her central task , Brexit be part of create the right condition for success . Theresa May ' s ambitious plan for the UK need more money to be spend . we have to move on from austerity now the deficit be under good control . stop our large financial contribution to the EU be the easy way of afford a domestic boost to the economy . with the money we save we can hire more nurse and doctor to relieve our NHS . we can promote more affordable housing , cut domestic fuel bill by remove VAT and pay enough to ensure a smooth transition to the new Universal Credit benefit . conservative do not want to cut disability benefit or short-change those seek work in need of financial help . with our Â£10billion a year back , we do n't have to make these unpopular cut . much of what need doing require good competent government , not more legislation . benefit reform remain a massive task but the crucial legislation be pass . build more road and railway require harness public and private sector for large project and make decision , not more law . the government will be judge by some on how it solve the need for more London airport capacity and how it progress HS2 and Trident . decision will soon be forthcoming , though the result will not be see this decade . more important for our prospect for the next five year will be a whole host of small and quick project to remove road and rail congestion . we must improve current network and service and find extra capacity to reduce the overcrowding we be now experience . we need to build a new generation of gas-fired power station for more reliable and affordable electricity . the government be right to review whether to build a new nuclear power plant at Hinkley Point . but we need either that or the equivalent reliable electricity capacity to keep the light on . there may be a good answer with cheap power . the single most important thing the government could do to reunite our country and progress its agenda of good opportunity and life chance for all be to hit its immigration target . that mean early Brexit to take back control of our border . it need a fair immigration system for the whole world , no longer give unlimited access only to Europeans . for business and education we need to ensure access for student and people with the skill we need . to ease shortage of home , downward pressure on wage and to relieve pressure on hospital and school place we do need to control number well . some say Theresa May ' S agenda be too ambitious give a small Conservative majority and the complexity they see in Brexit . I be all for some ambition , especially when that ambition be gear to improve the life and income of the many . success will come from realise Brexit be central to success and easy to bring about than many so-called expert want you to believe . there be too many highly pay lawyer and consultant who want to make a meal of it . it be , in the end , very simple . we take back control of our border , our money and our law by a very short Act of Parliament . we talk to the rest of the EU under their Article @card@ about what barrier and tariff they want to impose , if any , on their very lucrative trade with us . if they want to self-harm , we trade under global rule with them just like the US and China do . I suspect they will actually want to keep their more favourable access to our market . Let ' s get on with an agenda that bring the country together , spend the EU contribution to help us do so . let us create prosperity for the many , with the UK open for business with the world . Theresa too ambitious ? I ' m all for some ambition
