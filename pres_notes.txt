PRÄSI NOTES

1 Motivation

People opinion about newest topicsNewspaper (political stance) influence public opinion, so the language is importantErleichtern der Meinungsbildung, wenn schon weiß How newspaper presents a topic

Talk about corpus:
Brexit, Telegraph/Guardian/Sun, 3000 articles, übergang to next slide > pipeline

2 Pipeline

We oriented our work toward Burscher et al. they diachronically analysed the frames in the nuclear power debate
What we tried out so far
-corpus > preprocessing
-topic modelling (LDA, we all know from lecture)
-feature vectors (what does this mean?)
-clustering, k-means (bisecting)-Sentiment Analysis, including negation and aspect based?

-…and manual annotation of topics, sentiment, etc. (also lda requires some manual input) 

3 Initial results
-talk about Abbildungen - what do they mean
-HOWEVER, we haven’t yet done any manual evaluation / have no comparison
-initial results show no meaningful difference between articles
-we have now enlarged our corpus, ‘Telegraph’
-changes to preprocessing: remove more words in initial stage
-sentiment analysis???

4 What we still need to do
-manual evaluation
-refinement of clustering/topic modelling methods
